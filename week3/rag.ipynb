But when software\\nfails—when its users are dissatisfied, when it is error prone, when it is difficult to change\\nand even harder to use—bad things can and do happen. We all want to build software that\\nmakes things better, avoiding the bad things that lurk in the shadow of failed efforts. To\\nsucceed, we need discipline when software is designed and built. We need an engineer-\\ning approach.\\nIt has been almost three decades since the first edition of this book was written. During\\nthat time, software engineering has evolved from an obscure idea practiced by a relatively\\nsmall number of zealots to a legitimate engineering discipline. Today, it is recognized as a\\nsubject worthy of serious research, conscientious study, and tumultuous debate. Through-\\nout the industry, software engineer has replaced programmer as the job title of preference.\\nSoftware process models, software engineering methods, and software tools have been\\nadopted successfully across a broad spectrum of industry segments.\\nAlthough managers and practitioners alike recognize the need for a more disciplined\\napproach to software, they continue to debate the manner in which discipline is to be\\napplied. Many individuals and companies still develop software haphazardly, even as they\\nbuild systems to service today’s most advanced technologies. Many professionals and\\nstudents are unaware of modern methods. And as a result, the quality of the software that\\nwe produce suffers, and bad things happen. In addition, debate and controversy about the\\ntrue nature of the software engineering approach continue. The status of software engi-\\nneering is a study in contrasts. Attitudes have changed, progress has been made, but\\nmuch remains to be done before the discipline reaches full maturity.\\nThe seventh edition of Software Engineering: A Practitioner’s Approach is intended to\\nserve as a guide to a maturing engineering discipline. Like the six editions that preceded it,\\nthe seventh edition is intended for both students and practitioners, retaining its appeal as\\na guide to the industry professional and a comprehensive introduction to the student at the\\nupper-level undergraduate or first-year graduate level.\\nThe seventh edition is considerably more than a simple update. The book has been\\nrevised and restructured to improve pedagogical flow and emphasize new and important\\nsoftware engineering processes and practices.

The framework encompasses a process, a\\nset of methods, and an array of tools that we call software engineering.\\n1.1 T HE NATURE OF SOFTWARE\\nToday, software takes on a dual role. It is a product, and at the same time, the vehi-\\ncle for delivering a product. As a product, it delivers the computing potential em-\\nbodied by computer hardware or more broadly, by a network of computers that are\\naccessible by local hardware. Whether it resides within a mobile phone or operates\\ninside a mainframe computer, software is an information transformer—producing,\\nmanaging, acquiring, modifying, displaying, or transmitting information that can be\\nas simple as a single bit or as complex as a multimedia presentation derived from\\ndata acquired from dozens of independent sources. As the vehicle used to deliver the\\nproduct, software acts as the basis for the control of the computer (operating sys-\\ntems), the communication of information (networks), and the creation and control\\nof other programs (software tools and environments).\\nSoftware delivers the most important product of our time—information. It trans-\\nforms personal data (e.g., an individual’s financial transactions) so that the data can\\nbe more useful in a local context; it manages business information to enhance com-\\npetitiveness; it provides a gateway to worldwide information networks (e.g., the\\nInternet), and provides the means for acquiring information in all of its forms.\\nThe role of computer software has undergone significant change over the last\\nhalf-century. Dramatic improvements in hardware performance, profound changes\\nin computing architectures, vast increases in memory and storage capacity, and a\\nwide variety of exotic input and output options, have all precipitated more sophisti-\\ncated and complex computer-based systems. Sophistication and complexity can\\nproduce dazzling results when a system succeeds, but they can also pose huge\\nproblems for those who must build complex systems.\\nToday, a huge software industry has become a dominant factor in the economies\\nof the industrialized world. Teams of software specialists, each focusing on one part\\nof the technology required to deliver a complex application, have replaced the lone\\nprogrammer of an earlier era. And yet, the questions that were asked of the lone\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 3\\nSoftware is both a\\nproduct and a vehicle\\nthat delivers a product.\\nuote:\\n“Software is a\\nplace where\\ndreams are planted\\nand nightmares\\nharvested, an\\nabstract, mystical\\nswamp where\\nterrible demons\\ncompete with\\nmagical panaceas,\\na world of\\nwerewolves and\\nsilver bullets.”\\nBrad J.

He states: “Instead of asking why software costs so much, we need to begin asking ‘What\\nhave we done to make it possible for today’s software to cost so little?’ The answer to that ques-\\ntion will help us continue the extraordinary level of achievement that has always distinguished the\\nsoftware industry.”\\n• Why does it take so long to get software finished?\\n• Why are development costs so high?\\n• Why can’t we find all errors before we give the software to our customers?\\n• Why do we spend so much time and effort maintaining existing \\nprograms?\\n• Why do we continue to have difficulty in measuring progress as software is\\nbeing developed and maintained?\\nThese, and many other questions, are a manifestation of the concern about\\nsoftware and the manner in which it is developed—a concern that has lead to the\\nadoption of software engineering practice.\\n1.1.1 Defining Software\\nToday, most professionals and many members of the public at large feel that they\\nunderstand software. But do they?\\nA textbook description of software might take the following form: \\nSoftware is: (1) instructions (computer programs) that when executed provide desired\\nfeatures, function, and performance; (2) data structures that enable the programs to ad-\\nequately manipulate information, and (3) descriptive information in both hard copy and\\nvirtual forms that describes the operation and use of the programs.\\nThere is no question that other more complete definitions could be offered.\\nBut a more formal definition probably won’t measurably improve your under-\\nstanding. To accomplish that, it’s important to examine the characteristics of soft-\\nware that make it different from other things that human beings build. Software is a\\nlogical rather than a physical system element. Therefore, software has characteris-\\ntics that are considerably different than those of hardware:\\n1. Software is developed or engineered; it is not manufactured in the classical sense.\\nAlthough some similarities exist between software development and hard-\\nware manufacturing, the two activities are fundamentally different. In both\\nactivities, high quality is achieved through good design, but the manufactur-\\ning phase for hardware can introduce quality problems that are nonexistent\\nHow should\\nwe define\\nsoftware?\\n?\\nSoftware is\\nengineered, not\\nmanufactured.\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 4'),\n",

Both activities are dependent on people,\\nbut the relationship between people applied and work accomplished is\\nentirely different (see Chapter 24). Both activities require the construction of\\na “product,” but the approaches are different. Software costs are concen-\\ntrated in engineering. This means that software projects cannot be managed\\nas if they were manufacturing projects.\\n2. Software doesn’t “wear out.”\\nFigure 1.1 depicts failure rate as a function of time for hardware. The rela-\\ntionship, often called the “bathtub curve,” indicates that hardware exhibits\\nrelatively high failure rates early in its life (these failures are often attributa-\\nble to design or manufacturing defects); defects are corrected and the failure\\nrate drops to a steady-state level (hopefully, quite low) for some period of\\ntime. As time passes, however, the failure rate rises again as hardware com-\\nponents suffer from the cumulative effects of dust, vibration, abuse, tempera-\\nture extremes, and many other environmental maladies. Stated simply, the\\nhardware begins to wear out.\\nSoftware is not susceptible to the environmental maladies that cause\\nhardware to wear out. In theory, therefore, the failure rate curve for software\\nshould take the form of the “idealized curve” shown in Figure 1.2. Undiscov-\\nered defects will cause high failure rates early in the life of a program.\\nHowever, these are corrected and the curve flattens as shown. The idealized\\ncurve is a gross oversimplification of actual failure models for software.\\nHowever, the implication is clear—software doesn’t wear out. But it does\\ndeteriorate!\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 5\\n“Wear out”“Infant\\nmortality”\\nTime\\nFailure rate\\nFIGURE 1.1\\nFailure curve\\nfor hardware\\nSoftware doesn’t wear\\nout, but it does\\ndeteriorate.\\nIf you want to reduce\\nsoftware deterioration,\\nyou’ll have to do\\nbetter software design\\n(Chapters 8 to 13).\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 5'),\n",

During its life,2 software will undergo change. As\\nchanges are made, it is likely that errors will be introduced, causing the\\nfailure rate curve to spike as shown in the “actual curve” (Figure 1.2). Before\\nthe curve can return to the original steady-state failure rate, another change\\nis requested, causing the curve to spike again. Slowly, the minimum failure\\nrate level begins to rise—the software is deteriorating due to change.\\nAnother aspect of wear illustrates the difference between hardware and\\nsoftware. When a hardware component wears out, it is replaced by a spare\\npart. There are no software spare parts. Every software failure indicates an\\nerror in design or in the process through which design was translated into\\nmachine executable code.

Modern reusable components encap-\\nsulate both data and the processing that is applied to the data, enabling the\\nsoftware engineer to create new applications from reusable parts.\\n3 For exam-\\nple, today’s interactive user interfaces are built with reusable components\\nthat enable the creation of graphics windows, pull-down menus, and a wide\\nvariety of interaction mechanisms. The data structures and processing detail\\nrequired to build the interface are contained within a library of reusable\\ncomponents for interface construction.\\n1.1.2 Software Application Domains\\nToday, seven broad categories of computer software present continuing challenges\\nfor software engineers:\\nSystem software—a collection of programs written to service other pro-\\ngrams. Some system software (e.g., compilers, editors, and file management\\nutilities) processes complex, but determinate,\\n4 information structures. Other\\nsystems applications (e.g., operating system components, drivers, networking\\nsoftware, telecommunications processors) process largely indeterminate data.\\nIn either case, the systems software area is characterized by heavy interaction\\nwith computer hardware; heavy usage by multiple users; concurrent opera-\\ntion that requires scheduling, resource sharing, and sophisticated process\\nmanagement; complex data structures; and multiple external interfaces.\\nApplication software—stand-alone programs that solve a specific business\\nneed. Applications in this area process business or technical data in a way\\nthat facilitates business operations or management/technical decision mak-\\ning. In addition to conventional data processing applications, application\\nsoftware is used to control business functions in real time (e.g., point-of-sale\\ntransaction processing, real-time manufacturing process control).\\nEngineering/scientific software—has been characterized by “number\\ncrunching” algorithms. Applications range from astronomy to volcanology,\\nfrom automotive stress analysis to space shuttle orbital dynamics, and\\nfrom molecular biology to automated manufacturing. However, modern\\napplications within the engineering/scientific area are moving away from\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 7\\n3 Component-based development is discussed in Chapter 10.\\n4 Software is determinate if the order and timing of inputs, processing, and outputs is predictable.\\nSoftware is indeterminate if the order and timing of inputs, processing, and outputs cannot be\\npredicted in advance.\\nWebRef\\nOne of the most\\ncomprehensive libraries\\nof shareware/ freeware\\ncan be found at\\nshareware.cnet\\n.com\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 7'),\n",

Computer-aided design, system simula-\\ntion, and other interactive applications have begun to take on real-time and\\neven system software characteristics.\\nEmbedded software—resides within a product or system and is used to\\nimplement and control features and functions for the end user and for the\\nsystem itself. Embedded software can perform limited and esoteric functions\\n(e.g., key pad control for a microwave oven) or provide significant function\\nand control capability (e.g., digital functions in an automobile such as fuel\\ncontrol, dashboard displays, and braking systems).\\nProduct-line software—designed to provide a specific capability for use by\\nmany different customers. Product-line software can focus on a limited and\\nesoteric marketplace (e.g., inventory control products) or address mass\\nconsumer markets (e.g., word processing, spreadsheets, computer graphics,\\nmultimedia, entertainment, database management, and personal and\\nbusiness financial applications).\\nWeb applications—called “WebApps,” this network-centric software cate-\\ngory spans a wide array of applications. In their simplest form, WebApps can\\nbe little more than a set of linked hypertext files that present information\\nusing text and limited graphics. However, as Web 2.0 emerges, WebApps are\\nevolving into sophisticated computing environments that not only provide\\nstand-alone features, computing functions, and content to the end user, but\\nalso are integrated with corporate databases and business applications.\\nArtificial intelligence software—makes use of nonnumerical algorithms to\\nsolve complex problems that are not amenable to computation or straightfor-\\nward analysis. Applications within this area include robotics, expert systems,\\npattern recognition (image and voice), artificial neural networks, theorem\\nproving, and game playing.\\nMillions of software engineers worldwide are hard at work on software projects in\\none or more of these categories. In some cases, new systems are being built, but in\\nmany others, existing applications are being corrected, adapted, and enhanced. It is\\nnot uncommon for a young software engineer to work a program that is older than\\nshe is! Past generations of software people have left a legacy in each of the cate-\\ngories I have discussed. Hopefully, the legacy to be left behind by this generation will\\nease the burden of future software engineers. And yet, new challenges (Chapter 31)\\nhave appeared on the horizon:\\nOpen-world computing—the rapid growth of wireless networking may\\nsoon lead to true pervasive, distributed computing. The challenge for soft-\\nware engineers will be to develop systems and application software that will\\nallow mobile devices, personal computers, and enterprise systems to com-\\nmunicate across vast networks.\\n8 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\\nuote:\\n“There is no\\ncomputer that has\\ncommon sense.”\\nMarvin Minsky\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 8'),\n",

Some of these are state-\\nof-the-art software—just released to individuals, industry, and government. But\\nother programs are older, in some cases much older.\\nThese older programs—often referred to as legacy software—have been the focus\\nof continuous attention and concern since the 1960s. Dayani-Fard and his\\ncolleagues [Day99] describe legacy software in the following way:\\nLegacy software systems . . . were developed decades ago and have been continually\\nmodified to meet changes in business requirements and computing platforms. The pro-\\nliferation of such systems is causing headaches for large organizations who find them\\ncostly to maintain and risky to evolve.\\nLiu and his colleagues [Liu98] extend this description by noting that “many legacy\\nsystems remain supportive to core business functions and are ‘indispensable’ to\\nthe business.” Hence, legacy software is characterized by longevity and business\\ncriticality.\\nUnfortunately, there is sometimes one additional characteristic that is present\\nin legacy software— poor quality.\\n5 Legacy systems sometimes have inextensible\\ndesigns, convoluted code, poor or nonexistent documentation, test cases and results\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 9\\nuote:\\n“You can’t always\\npredict, but you\\ncan always\\nprepare.”\\nAnonymous\\n5 In this case, quality is judged based on modern software engineering thinking—a somewhat unfair\\ncriterion since some modern software engineering concepts and principles may not have been well\\nunderstood at the time that the legacy software was developed.\\nWhat do I do\\nif I encounter\\na legacy system\\nthat exhibits poor\\nquality?\\n?\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 9'),\n",

And yet, these systems support “core business functions and are indispensable\\nto the business.” What to do?\\nThe only reasonable answer may be: Do nothing, at least until the legacy system\\nmust undergo some significant change. If the legacy software meets the needs of its\\nusers and runs reliably, it isn’t broken and does not need to be fixed. However, as\\ntime passes, legacy systems often evolve for one or more of the following reasons:\\n• The software must be adapted to meet the needs of new computing environ-\\nments or technology.\\n• The software must be enhanced to implement new business requirements.\\n• The software must be extended to make it interoperable with other more\\nmodern systems or databases.\\n• The software must be re-architected to make it viable within a network\\nenvironment.\\nWhen these modes of evolution occur, a legacy system must be reengineered (Chap-\\nter 29) so that it remains viable into the future. The goal of modern software engi-\\nneering is to “devise methodologies that are founded on the notion of evolution”;\\nthat is, the notion that software systems continually change, new software systems\\nare built from the old ones, and . . . all must interoperate and cooperate with each\\nother” [Day99].\\n1.2 T HE UNIQUE NATURE OF WEB APPS\\nIn the early days of the World Wide Web (circa 1990 to 1995), websites consisted of\\nlittle more than a set of linked hypertext files that presented information using text\\nand limited graphics. As time passed, the augmentation of HTML by development\\ntools (e.g., XML, Java) enabled Web engineers to provide computing capability along\\nwith informational content. Web-based systems and applications\\n6 (I refer to these col-\\nlectively as WebApps) were born. Today, WebApps have evolved into sophisticated\\ncomputing tools that not only provide stand-alone function to the end user, but also\\nhave been integrated with corporate databases and business applications.\\nAs noted in Section 1.1.2, WebApps are one of a number of distinct software cat-\\negories. And yet, it can be argued that WebApps are different. Powell [Pow98] sug-\\ngests that Web-based systems and applications “involve a mixture between print\\npublishing and software development, between marketing and computing, between\\n10 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\\nWhat types\\nof changes\\nare made to\\nlegacy systems?\\n?\\nEvery software\\nengineer must\\nrecognize that change\\nis natural.

A WebApp resides on a network and must serve\\nthe needs of a diverse community of clients. The network may enable world-\\nwide access and communication (i.e., the Internet) or more limited access\\nand communication (e.g., a corporate Intranet).\\nConcurrency. A large number of users may access the WebApp at one\\ntime. In many cases, the patterns of usage among end users will vary greatly.\\nUnpredictable load. The number of users of the WebApp may vary by\\norders of magnitude from day to day. One hundred users may show up on\\nMonday; 10,000 may use the system on Thursday.\\nPerformance. If a WebApp user must wait too long (for access, for server-\\nside processing, for client-side formatting and display), he or she may decide\\nto go elsewhere.\\nAvailability. Although expectation of 100 percent availability is unreason-\\nable, users of popular WebApps often demand access on a 24/7/365 basis.\\nUsers in Australia or Asia might demand access during times when tradi-\\ntional domestic software applications in North America might be taken \\noff-line for maintenance.\\nData driven. The primary function of many WebApps is to use hypermedia\\nto present text, graphics, audio, and video content to the end user. In addi-\\ntion, WebApps are commonly used to access information that exists on data-\\nbases that are not an integral part of the Web-based environment (e.g.,\\ne-commerce or financial applications).\\nContent sensitive. The quality and aesthetic nature of content remains an\\nimportant determinant of the quality of a WebApp.\\nContinuous evolution. Unlike conventional application software that\\nevolves over a series of planned, chronologically spaced releases, Web appli-\\ncations evolve continuously. It is not unusual for some WebApps (specifically,\\ntheir content) to be updated on a minute-by-minute schedule or for content\\nto be independently computed for each request.\\nImmediacy. Although immediacy—the compelling need to get software to\\nmarket quickly—is a characteristic of many application domains, WebApps\\noften exhibit a time-to-market that can be a matter of a few days or weeks.\\n7\\nSecurity. Because WebApps are available via network access, it is difficult,\\nif not impossible, to limit the population of end users who may access the\\napplication.

When a new application or embedded system is to be built, many\\nvoices must be heard. And it sometimes seems that each of them has a\\nslightly different idea of what software features and functions should be\\ndelivered. It follows that a concerted effort should be made to understand the\\nproblem before a software solution is developed.\\n• The information technology requirements demanded by individuals, busi-\\nnesses, and governments grow increasing complex with each passing year.\\nLarge teams of people now create computer programs that were once built\\nby a single individual. Sophisticated software that was once implemented in\\na predictable, self-contained, computing environment is now embedded\\ninside everything from consumer electronics to medical devices to weapons\\nsystems. The complexity of these new computer-based systems and products\\ndemands careful attention to the interactions of all system elements. It\\nfollows that design becomes a pivotal activity.\\n• Individuals, businesses, and governments increasingly rely on software for\\nstrategic and tactical decision making as well as day-to-day operations and\\ncontrol. If the software fails, people and major enterprises can experience\\nanything from minor inconvenience to catastrophic failures. It follows that\\nsoftware should exhibit high quality.\\n• As the perceived value of a specific application grows, the likelihood is that\\nits user base and longevity will also grow.

It follows\\nthat software should be maintainable.\\nThese simple realities lead to one conclusion:software in all of its forms and across all\\nof its application domains should be engineered. And that leads us to the topic of this\\nbook—software engineering.\\nAlthough hundreds of authors have developed personal definitions of software\\nengineering, a definition proposed by Fritz Bauer [Nau69] at the seminal conference\\non the subject still serves as a basis for discussion:\\n[Software engineering is] the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in or-\\nder to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.\\nYou will be tempted to add to this definition.9 It says little about the technical as-\\npects of software quality; it does not directly address the need for customer satisfac-\\ntion or timely product delivery; it omits mention of the importance of measurement\\nand metrics; it does not state the importance of an effective process. And yet, Bauer’s\\ndefinition provides us with a baseline. What are the “sound engineering principles”\\nthat can be applied to computer software development? How do we “economically”\\nbuild software so that it is “reliable”? What is required to create computer programs\\nthat work “efficiently” on not one but many different “real machines”? These are the\\nquestions that continue to challenge software engineers.\\nThe IEEE [IEE93a] has developed a more comprehensive definition when it states:\\nSoftware Engineering: (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach\\nto the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of\\nengineering to software. (2) The study of approaches as in (1).\\nAnd yet, a “systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable” approach applied by one\\nsoftware team may be burdensome to another. We need discipline, but we also need\\nadaptability and agility.\\nSoftware engineering is a layered technology. Referring to Figure 1.3, any engineer-\\ning approach (including software engineering) must rest on an organizational com-\\nmitment to quality. Total quality management, Six Sigma, and similar philosophies\\n10\\nfoster a continuous process improvement culture, and it is this culture that ultimately\\nleads to the development of increasingly more effective approaches to software engi-\\nneering.

These process models are generally characterized as “agile” be-\\ncause they emphasize maneuverability and adaptability. They are appropriate for many\\ntypes of projects and are particularly useful when Web applications are engineered.\\n1.5 S OFTWARE ENGINEERING PRACTICE\\nIn Section 1.4, I introduced a generic software process model composed of a set of\\nactivities that establish a framework for software engineering practice. Generic\\nframework activities—communication, planning, modeling, construction, and\\ndeployment—and umbrella activities establish a skeleton architecture for software\\nengineering work.

Carry out the plan (code generation).\\n4. Examine the result for accuracy (testing and quality assurance).\\nIn the context of software engineering, these commonsense steps lead to a series of\\nessential questions [adapted from Pol45]:\\nUnderstand the problem. It’s sometimes difficult to admit, but most of us suffer\\nfrom hubris when we’re presented with a problem. We listen for a few seconds and\\nthen think, Oh yeah, I understand, let’s get on with solving this thing. Unfortunately,\\nunderstanding isn’t always that easy. It’s worth spending a little time answering a\\nfew simple questions:\\n• Who has a stake in the solution to the problem? That is, who are the stake-\\nholders?\\n• What are the unknowns? What data, functions, and features are required to\\nproperly solve the problem?\\n• Can the problem be compartmentalized? Is it possible to represent smaller\\nproblems that may be easier to understand?\\n• Can the problem be represented graphically?Can an analysis model be created?\\nPlan the solution. Now you understand the problem (or so you think) and you\\ncan’t wait to begin coding. Before you do, slow down just a bit and do a little\\ndesign:\\n• Have you seen similar problems before? Are there patterns that are recogniz-\\nable in a potential solution? Is there existing software that implements the\\ndata, functions, and features that are required?\\n• Has a similar problem been solved? If so, are elements of the solution\\nreusable?\\n• Can subproblems be defined? If so, are solutions readily apparent for the\\nsubproblems?\\n• Can you represent a solution in a manner that leads to effective implementation?\\nCan a design model be created?\\nCarry out the plan. The design you’ve created serves as a road map for the\\nsystem you want to build. There may be unexpected detours, and it’s possible that\\nyou’ll discover an even better route as you go, but the “plan” will allow you to\\nproceed without getting lost.\\n• Does the solution conform to the plan? Is source code traceable to the design\\nmodel?\\n• Is each component part of the solution provably correct? Have the design and\\ncode been reviewed, or better, have correctness proofs been applied to the\\nalgorithm?\\n18 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\\nuote:\\n“There is a grain of\\ndiscovery in the\\nsolution of any\\nproblem.”\\nGeorge Polya\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 18'),\n",

In fact, it’s\\nreasonable to state that a commonsense approach to software engineering will\\nnever lead you astray.\\n1.5.2 General Principles\\nThe dictionary defines the word principle as “an important underlying law or as-\\nsumption required in a system of thought.” Throughout this book I’ll discuss princi-\\nples at many different levels of abstraction. Some focus on software engineering as a\\nwhole, others consider a specific generic framework activity (e.g., communication),\\nand still others focus on software engineering actions (e.g., architectural design) or\\ntechnical tasks (e.g., write a usage scenario). Regardless of their level of focus, prin-\\nciples help you establish a mind-set for solid software engineering practice. They are\\nimportant for that reason.\\nDavid Hooker [Hoo96] has proposed seven principles that focus on software\\nengineering practice as a whole. They are reproduced in the following\\nparagraphs:\\n13\\nThe First Principle: The Reason It All Exists\\nA software system exists for one reason: to provide value to its users. All\\ndecisions should be made with this in mind. Before specifying a system require-\\nment, before noting a piece of system functionality, before determining the hard-\\nware platforms or development processes, ask yourself questions such as: “Does\\nthis add real value to the system?” If the answer is “no,” don’t do it. All other\\nprinciples support this one.\\nThe Second Principle: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!)\\nSoftware design is not a haphazard process. There are many factors to consider\\nin any design effort. All design should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. This\\nfacilitates having a more easily understood and easily maintained system. This is\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 19\\n13 Reproduced with permission of the author [Hoo96]. Hooker defines patterns for these principles at\\nhttp:/ /c2.com/cgi/wiki?SevenPrinciplesOfSoftwareDevelopment.\\nBefore beginning a\\nsoftware project, be\\nsure the software has\\na business purpose and\\nthat users perceive\\nvalue in it.\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 19'),\n",

Indeed, the more elegant designs are usually the more simple ones. Sim-\\nple also does not mean “quick and dirty.” In fact, it often takes a lot of thought and\\nwork over multiple iterations to simplify. The payoff is software that is more main-\\ntainable and less error-prone.\\nThe Third Principle: Maintain the Vision\\nA clear vision is essential to the success of a software project. Without one, a\\nproject almost unfailingly ends up being “of two [or more] minds” about itself.\\nWithout conceptual integrity, a system threatens to become a patchwork of in-\\ncompatible designs, held together by the wrong kind of screws. . . . Compromis-\\ning the architectural vision of a software system weakens and will eventually\\nbreak even the well-designed systems. Having an empowered architect who can\\nhold the vision and enforce compliance helps ensure a very successful software\\nproject.\\nThe Fourth Principle: What You Produce, Others Will Consume\\nSeldom is an industrial-strength software system constructed and used in a\\nvacuum. In some way or other, someone else will use, maintain, document, or\\notherwise depend on being able to understand your system. So, always specify,\\ndesign, and implement knowing someone else will have to understand what you are\\ndoing. The audience for any product of software development is potentially large.\\nSpecify with an eye to the users. Design, keeping the implementers in mind. Code\\nwith concern for those that must maintain and extend the system. Someone may\\nhave to debug the code you write, and that makes them a user of your code.\\nMaking their job easier adds value to the system.\\nThe Fifth Principle: Be Open to the Future\\nA system with a long lifetime has more value. In today’s computing environ-\\nments, where specifications change on a moment’s notice and hardware platforms\\nare obsolete just a few months old, software lifetimes are typically measured in\\nmonths instead of years. However, true “industrial-strength” software systems\\nmust endure far longer. To do this successfully, these systems must be ready to\\nadapt to these and other changes. Systems that do this successfully are those that\\nhave been designed this way from the start. Never design yourself into a corner.\\nAlways ask “what if,” and prepare for all possible answers by creating systems that\\nsolve the general problem, not just the specific one.\\n14 This could very possibly lead\\nto the reuse of an entire system.\\n20 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\\nIf software has value,\\nit will change over its\\nuseful life. For that\\nreason, software must\\nbe built to be\\nmaintainable.\\n14 This advice can be dangerous if it is taken to extremes. Designing for the “general problem” some-\\ntimes requires performance compromises and can make specific solutions inefficient.\\nuote:\\n“There is a certain\\nmajesty in\\nsimplicity which is\\nfar above all the\\nquaintness of wit.”\\nAlexander Pope\\n(1688–1744)\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 20'),\n",

The reuse of code and\\ndesigns has been proclaimed as a major benefit of using object-oriented technolo-\\ngies. However, the return on this investment is not automatic. To leverage the\\nreuse possibilities that object-oriented [or conventional] programming provides\\nrequires forethought and planning. There are many techniques to realize reuse\\nat every level of the system development process. . . . Planning ahead for reuse\\nreduces the cost and increases the value of both the reusable components and the\\nsystems into which they are incorporated.\\nThe Seventh principle: Think!\\nThis last principle is probably the most overlooked. Placing clear, complete\\nthought before action almost always produces better results. When you think about\\nsomething, you are more likely to do it right. You also gain knowledge about how\\nto do it right again. If you do think about something and still do it wrong, it be-\\ncomes a valuable experience. A side effect of thinking is learning to recognize\\nwhen you don’t know something, at which point you can research the answer.\\nWhen clear thought has gone into a system, value comes out. Applying the first six\\nprinciples requires intense thought, for which the potential rewards are enormous.\\nIf every software engineer and every software team simply followed Hooker’s seven\\nprinciples, many of the difficulties we experience in building complex computer-\\nbased systems would be eliminated.\\n1.6 S OFTWARE MYTHS\\nSoftware myths—erroneous beliefs about software and the process that is used to\\nbuild it—can be traced to the earliest days of computing. Myths have a number of\\nattributes that make them insidious. For instance, they appear to be reasonable\\nstatements of fact (sometimes containing elements of truth), they have an intuitive\\nfeel, and they are often promulgated by experienced practitioners who “know the\\nscore.”\\nToday, most knowledgeable software engineering professionals recognize myths\\nfor what they are—misleading attitudes that have caused serious problems for\\nmanagers and practitioners alike. However, old attitudes and habits are difficult to\\nmodify, and remnants of software myths remain.\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 21\\n15 Although this is true for those who reuse the software on future projects, reuse can be expensive\\nfor those who must design and build reusable components. Studies indicate that designing and\\nbuilding reusable components can cost between 25 to 200 percent more than targeted software. In\\nsome cases, the cost differential cannot be justified.\\nuote:\\n“In the absence of\\nmeaningful\\nstandards, a new\\nindustry like\\nsoftware comes to\\ndepend instead on\\nfolklore.”\\nTom DeMarco\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 21'),\n",

Won’t that provide my people with everything they\\nneed to know?\\nReality: The book of standards may very well exist, but is it used? Are soft-\\nware practitioners aware of its existence?

In the words of Brooks [Bro95]: “adding people to a late soft-\\nware project makes it later.” At first, this statement may seem\\ncounterintuitive. However, as new people are added, people who\\nwere working must spend time educating the newcomers, thereby\\nreducing the amount of time spent on productive development\\neffort.

Over the\\npast 50 years, software has evolved from a specialized problem solving and infor-\\nmation analysis tool to an industry in itself. Yet we still have trouble developing high-\\nquality software on time and within budget.\\nSoftware—programs, data, and descriptive information—addresses a wide array\\nof technology and application areas. Legacy software continues to present special\\nchallenges to those who must maintain it.\\nWeb-based systems and applications have evolved from simple collections of in-\\nformation content to sophisticated systems that present complex functionality and\\nmultimedia content. Although these WebApps have unique features and require-\\nments, they are software nonetheless.\\nSoftware engineering encompasses process, methods, and tools that enable\\ncomplex computer-based systems to be built in a timely manner with quality. The\\nsoftware process incorporates five framework activities—communication, planning,\\nmodeling, construction, and deployment—that are applicable to all software proj-\\nects. Software engineering practice is a problem solving activity that follows a set of\\ncore principles.\\nA wide array of software myths continue to lead managers and practitioners\\nastray, even as our collective knowledge of software and the technologies required\\nto build it grows. As you learn more about software engineering, you’ll begin to un-\\nderstand why these myths should be debunked whenever they are encountered.\\nPROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER\\n1.1.

Books by Greenfield (Everyware: The Dawning Age\\nof Ubiquitous Computing, New Riders Publishing, 2006) and Loke ( Context-Aware Pervasive\\nSystems: Architectures for a New Breed of Applications, Auerbach, 2006) introduce the concept of\\n“open-world” software and predict a wireless environment in which software must adapt to\\nrequirements that emerge in real time.\\nThe current state of the software engineering and the software process can best be deter-\\nmined from publications such as IEEE Software, IEEE Computer, CrossTalk,and IEEE Transactions\\non Software Engineering.

The process is a dialogue in which the\\nknowledge that must become the software is brought together and embodied in the\\nsoftware. The process provides interaction between users and designers, between\\nusers and evolving tools, and between designers and evolving tools [technology]. It is\\nan iterative process in which the evolving tool itself serves as the medium for com-\\nmunication, with each new round of the dialogue eliciting more useful knowledge\\nfrom the people involved.\\nIndeed, building computer software is an iterative social learning process, and\\nthe outcome, something that Baetjer would call “software capital,” is an embodi-\\nment of knowledge collected, distilled, and organized as the process is conducted.\\n30\\nCHAPTER\\n2\\nPROCESS\\nMODELS\\nKEY\\nCONCEPTS\\ncomponent-based\\ndevelopment . . . . . .50\\nconcurrent models  . .48\\nevolutionary process\\nmodels  . . . . . . . . . .42\\nformal methods \\nmodel . . . . . . . . . . .51\\ngeneric process \\nmodel . . . . . . . . . . .31\\nincremental process\\nmodels  . . . . . . . . . .41\\npersonal software\\nprocess . . . . . . . . . .57\\nprescriptive process\\nmodels  . . . . . . . . . .38\\nprocess patterns  . . .35\\ntask set  . . . . . . . . .34\\nteam software \\nprocess . . . . . . . . . .58\\nUnified Process  . . . .53\\nWhat is it?When you work to build\\na product or system, it’s important to\\ngo through a series of predictable\\nsteps—a road map that helps you\\ncreate a timely, high-quality result. The road map\\nthat you follow is called a “software process.” \\nWho does it? Software engineers and their\\nmanagers adapt the process to their needs and\\nthen follow it. In addition, the people who have\\nrequested the software have a role to play in the\\nprocess of defining, building, and testing it. \\nWhy is it important? Because it provides\\nstability, control, and organization to an activity\\nthat can, if left uncontrolled, become quite\\nchaotic.

Within the\\ncontext of this book, I define a software processas a framework for the activities, ac-\\ntions, and tasks that are required to build high-quality software. Is “process” syn-\\nonymous with software engineering? The answer is “yes and no.” A software process\\ndefines the approach that is taken as software is engineered. But software engi-\\nneering also encompasses technologies that populate the process—technical meth-\\nods and automated tools.\\nMore important, software engineering is performed by creative, knowledgeable\\npeople who should adapt a mature software process so that it is appropriate for the\\nproducts that they build and the demands of their marketplace.\\n2.1 A G ENERIC PROCESS MODEL\\nIn Chapter 1, a process was defined as a collection of work activities, actions, and\\ntasks that are performed when some work product is to be created. Each of these\\nactivities, actions, and tasks reside within a framework or model that defines their\\nrelationship with the process and with one another.\\nThe software process is represented schematically in Figure 2.1. Referring to the\\nfigure, each framework activity is populated by a set of software engineering actions.\\nEach software engineering action is defined by a task set that identifies the work\\ntasks that are to be completed, the work products that will be produced, the quality\\nassurance points that will be required, and the milestones that will be used to indi-\\ncate progress.\\nAs I discussed in Chapter 1, a generic process framework for software engineer-\\ning defines five framework activities—communication, planning, modeling,\\nconstruction, and deployment. In addition, a set of umbrella activities—project\\ntracking and control, risk management, quality assurance, configuration manage-\\nment, technical reviews, and others—are applied throughout the process.\\nYou should note that one important aspect of the software process has not\\nyet been discussed. This aspect—called process flow—describes how the frame-\\nwork activities and the actions and tasks that occur within each framework\\nactivity are organized with respect to sequence and time and is illustrated in\\nFigure 2.2.\\nA linear process flow executes each of the five framework activities in sequence,\\nbeginning with communication and culminating with deployment (Figure 2.2a). An\\niterative process flow repeats one or more of the activities before proceeding to the\\nnext (Figure 2.2b). An evolutionary process flow executes the activities in a “circular”\\nmanner. Each circuit through the five activities leads to a more complete version\\nof the software (Figure 2.2c). A parallel process flow (Figure 2.2d) executes one or\\nmore activities in parallel with other activities (e.g., modeling for one aspect of the\\nsoftware might be executed in parallel with construction of another aspect of the\\nsoftware).\\nThe hierarchy of\\ntechnical work within\\nthe software process is\\nactivities,\\nencompassing actions,\\npopulated by tasks.\\nuote:\\n“We think that\\nsoftware\\ndevelopers are\\nmissing a vital\\ntruth: most\\norganizations don’t\\nknow what they\\ndo.

Each of these software engineering\\nactions would have many work tasks and a number of distinct work products.\\n2.1.2 Identifying a Task Set\\nReferring again to Figure 2.1, each software engineering action (e.g., elicitation, an\\naction associated with the communication activity) can be represented by a number\\nof different task sets—each a collection of software engineering work tasks, related\\nwork products, quality assurance points, and project milestones. You should choose\\na task set that best accommodates the needs of the project and the characteristics of\\nyour team. This implies that a software engineering action can be adapted to the spe-\\ncific needs of the software project and the characteristics of the project team. \\n34 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\nTask Set\\nA task set defines the actual work to be done\\nto accomplish the objectives of a software\\nengineering action. For example, elicitation (more\\ncommonly called “requirements gathering”) is an\\nimportant software engineering action that occurs during\\nthe communication activity. The goal of requirements\\ngathering is to understand what various stakeholders want\\nfrom the software that is to be built.\\nFor a small, relatively simple project, the task set for\\nrequirements gathering might look like this:\\n1. Make a list of stakeholders for the project.\\n2. Invite all stakeholders to an informal meeting.\\n3. Ask each stakeholder to make a list of features and\\nfunctions required.\\n4. Discuss requirements and build a final list.\\n5. Prioritize requirements.\\n6. Note areas of uncertainty.\\nFor a larger, more complex software project, a\\ndifferent task set would be required. It might encompass\\nthe following work tasks:\\n1. Make a list of stakeholders for the project.\\n2. Interview each stakeholder separately to determine\\noverall wants and needs.\\n3. Build a preliminary list of functions and features\\nbased on stakeholder input.\\n4. Schedule a series of facilitated application\\nspecification meetings.\\n5. Conduct meetings.\\n6. Produce informal user scenarios as part of each\\nmeeting.\\n7. Refine user scenarios based on stakeholder\\nfeedback.\\n8. Build a revised list of stakeholder requirements.\\n9. Use quality function deployment techniques to\\nprioritize requirements.\\n10. Package requirements so that they can be delivered\\nincrementally.\\n11. Note constraints and restrictions that will be placed\\non the system.\\n12. Discuss methods for validating the system.\\nBoth of these task sets achieve “requirements gathering,”\\nbut they are quite different in their depth and formality. The\\nsoftware team chooses the task set that will allow it to\\nachieve the goal of each action and still maintain quality\\nand agility.\\nINFO\\nDifferent projects\\ndemand different task\\nsets.

In other situations, patterns can be used to describe a prob-\\nlem (and solution) associated with a framework activity (e.g., planning) or an action\\nwithin a framework activity (e.g., project estimating).\\nAmbler [Amb98] has proposed a template for describing a process pattern:\\nPattern Name.

History has indicated that these traditional models\\nhave brought a certain amount of useful structure to software engineering work and\\nhave provided a reasonably effective road map for software teams. However, software\\nengineering work and the product that it produces remain on “the edge of chaos.”\\nIn an intriguing paper on the strange relationship between order and chaos in the\\nsoftware world, Nogueira and his colleagues [Nog00] state\\nThe edge of chaos is defined as “a natural state between order and chaos, a grand com-\\npromise between structure and surprise” [Kau95]. The edge of chaos can be visualized as\\nan unstable, partially structured state. . . . It is unstable because it is constantly attracted\\nto chaos or to absolute order.\\nWe have the tendency to think that order is the ideal state of nature. This could be a mis-\\ntake. Research . . . supports the theory that operation away from equilibrium generates cre-\\nativity, self-organized processes, and increasing returns [Roo96]. Absolute order means the\\nabsence of variability, which could be an advantage under unpredictable environments.\\nChange occurs when there is some structure so that the change can be organized, but not\\nso rigid that it cannot occur. Too much chaos, on the other hand, can make coordination\\nand coherence impossible. Lack of structure does not always mean disorder.\\nThe philosophical implications of this argument are significant for software engineer-\\ning. If prescriptive process models5 strive for structure and order, are they inappropri-\\nate for a software world that thrives on change? Yet, if we reject traditional process\\n38 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\n5 Prescriptive process models are sometimes referred to as “traditional” process models.\\nuote:\\n“Software\\norganizations have\\nexhibited\\nsignificant\\nshortcomings in\\ntheir ability to\\ncapitalize on the\\nexperiences gained\\nfrom completed\\nprojects.”\\nNASA\\nuote:\\n“If the process is\\nright, the results\\nwill take care of\\nthemselves.”\\nTakashi Osada\\npre75977_ch02.qxd  11/27/08  3:21 PM  Page 38'),\n",

In the sections that follow, I examine the prescriptive process\\napproach in which order and project consistency are dominant issues. I call them\\n“prescriptive” because they prescribe a set of process elements—framework activi-\\nties, software engineering actions, tasks, work products, quality assurance, and\\nchange control mechanisms for each project. Each process model also prescribes a\\nprocess flow (also called a work flow)—that is, the manner in which the process\\nelements are interrelated to one another.\\nAll software process models can accommodate the generic framework activities\\ndescribed in Chapter 1, but each applies a different emphasis to these activities and\\ndefines a process flow that invokes each framework activity (as well as software\\nengineering actions and tasks) in a different manner.\\n2.3.1 The Waterfall Model\\nThere are times when the requirements for a problem are well understood—when\\nwork flows from communicationthrough deployment in a reasonably linear fash-\\nion. This situation is sometimes encountered when well-defined adaptations or en-\\nhancements to an existing system must be made (e.g., an adaptation to accounting\\nsoftware that has been mandated because of changes to government regulations). It\\nmay also occur in a limited number of new development efforts, but only when\\nrequirements are well defined and reasonably stable.\\nThe waterfall model, sometimes called the classic life cycle, suggests a systematic,\\nsequential approach\\n6 to software development that begins with customer specifica-\\ntion of requirements and progresses through planning, modeling, construction, and\\ndeployment, culminating in ongoing support of the completed software (Figure 2.3).\\nA variation in the representation of the waterfall model is called the V-model.\\nRepresented in Figure 2.4, the V-model [Buc99] depicts the relationship of quality\\nCHAPTER 2 PROCESS MODELS 39\\nCommunication\\n project initiation\\n requirements gathering\\nPlanning\\n estimating\\n scheduling\\n tracking\\nModeling\\n analysis\\n design\\nDeployment\\n delivery\\n support\\n feedback\\nConstruction\\n code\\n test\\nFIGURE 2.3 The waterfall model\\n6 Although the original waterfall model proposed by Winston Royce [Roy70] made provision for\\n“feedback loops,” the vast majority of organizations that apply this process model treat it as if it\\nwere strictly linear.\\nPrescriptive process\\nmodels define a\\nprescribed set of\\nprocess elements and\\na predictable process\\nwork flow.\\npre75977_ch02.qxd  11/27/08  3:21 PM  Page 39'),\n",

It is often difficult for the customer to state all requirements explicitly. The\\nwaterfall model requires this and has difficulty accommodating the natural\\nuncertainty that exists at the beginning of many projects.\\n3. The customer must have patience. A working version of the program(s) will\\nnot be available until late in the project time span. A major blunder, if unde-\\ntected until the working program is reviewed, can be disastrous.\\nIn an interesting analysis of actual projects, Bradac [Bra94] found that the linear\\nnature of the classic life cycle leads to “blocking states” in which some project team\\nmembers must wait for other members of the team to complete dependent tasks. In\\nfact, the time spent waiting can exceed the time spent on productive work! The\\nblocking states tend to be more prevalent at the beginning and end of a linear\\nsequential process.\\nToday, software work is fast-paced and subject to a never-ending stream of\\nchanges (to features, functions, and information content). The waterfall model is\\noften inappropriate for such work. However, it can serve as a useful process model\\nin situations where requirements are fixed and work is to proceed to completion in\\na linear manner.\\n2.3.2 Incremental Process Models\\nThere are many situations in which initial software requirements are reasonably well\\ndefined, but the overall scope of the development effort precludes a purely linear\\nprocess. In addition, there may be a compelling need to provide a limited set of soft-\\nware functionality to users quickly and then refine and expand on that functionality\\nin later software releases. In such cases, you can choose a process model that is\\ndesigned to produce the software in increments.\\nThe incremental model combines elements of linear and parallel process flows\\ndiscussed in Section 2.1. Referring to Figure 2.5, the incremental model applies linear\\nsequences in a staggered fashion as calendar time progresses. Each linear sequence\\nproduces deliverable “increments” of the software [McD93] in a manner that is sim-\\nilar to the increments produced by an evolutionary process flow (Section 2.3.3).\\nFor example, word-processing software developed using the incremental para-\\ndigm might deliver basic file management, editing, and document production func-\\ntions in the first increment; more sophisticated editing and document production\\ncapabilities in the second increment; spelling and grammar checking in the third in-\\ncrement; and advanced page layout capability in the fourth increment. It should be\\nnoted that the process flow for any increment can incorporate the prototyping\\nparadigm. \\nWhen an incremental model is used, the first increment is often a core product.\\nThat is, basic requirements are addressed but many supplementary features (some\\nknown, others unknown) remain undelivered. The core product is used by the cus-\\ntomer (or undergoes detailed evaluation). As a result of use and/or evaluation, a\\nCHAPTER 2 PROCESS MODELS 41\\nuote:\\n“Too often,\\nsoftware work\\nfollows the first law\\nof bicycling: No\\nmatter where\\nyou’re going, it’s\\nuphill and against\\nthe wind.”\\nAuthor unknown\\nThe incremental model\\ndelivers a series of\\nreleases, called\\nincrements, that\\nprovide progressively\\nmore functionality for\\nthe customer as each\\nincrement is delivered.\\nYour customer\\ndemands delivery by a\\ndate that is impossible\\nto meet.

This process is repeated following the delivery of each\\nincrement, until the complete product is produced.\\nThe incremental process model focuses on the delivery of an operational product\\nwith each increment. Early increments are stripped-down versions of the final prod-\\nuct, but they do provide capability that serves the user and also provide a platform\\nfor evaluation by the user.\\n8\\nIncremental development is particularly useful when staffing is unavailable for a\\ncomplete implementation by the business deadline that has been established for the\\nproject.

In these and similar situations, you need a process model that has been\\nexplicitly designed to accommodate a product that evolves over time.\\nEvolutionary models are iterative. They are characterized in a manner that\\nenables you to develop increasingly more complete versions of the software. In the\\nparagraphs that follow, I present two common evolutionary process models.\\nPrototyping. Often, a customer defines a set of general objectives for software,\\nbut does not identify detailed requirements for functions and features. In other\\ncases, the developer may be unsure of the efficiency of an algorithm, the adapt-\\nability of an operating system, or the form that human-machine interaction should\\ntake. In these, and many other situations, a prototyping paradigm may offer the best\\napproach.\\nAlthough prototyping can be used as a stand-alone process model, it is more com-\\nmonly used as a technique that can be implemented within the context of any one\\nof the process models noted in this chapter. Regardless of the manner in which it is\\napplied, the prototyping paradigm assists you and other stakeholders to better\\nunderstand what is to be built when requirements are fuzzy.\\nThe prototyping paradigm (Figure 2.6) begins with communication. You meet with\\nother stakeholders to define the overall objectives for the software, identify whatever\\nrequirements are known, and outline areas where further definition is mandatory. A\\nprototyping iteration is planned quickly, and modeling (in the form of a “quick de-\\nsign”) occurs. A quick design focuses on a representation of those aspects of the soft-\\nware that will be visible to end users (e.g., human interface layout or output display\\nCHAPTER 2 PROCESS MODELS 43\\nuote:\\n“Plan to throw one\\naway.

The quick design leads to the construction of a prototype. The prototype is\\ndeployed and evaluated by stakeholders, who provide feedback that is used to fur-\\nther refine requirements. Iteration occurs as the prototype is tuned to satisfy the\\nneeds of various stakeholders, while at the same time enabling you to better under-\\nstand what needs to be done.\\nIdeally, the prototype serves as a mechanism for identifying software require-\\nments. If a working prototype is to be built, you can make use of existing program\\nfragments or apply tools (e.g., report generators and window managers) that enable\\nworking programs to be generated quickly.\\nBut what do you do with the prototype when it has served the purpose described\\nearlier? Brooks [Bro95] provides one answer:\\nIn most projects, the first system built is barely usable. It may be too slow, too big, awk-\\nward in use or all three. There is no alternative but to start again, smarting but smarter,\\nand build a redesigned version in which these problems are solved.\\nThe prototype can serve as “the first system.” The one that Brooks recommends\\nyou throw away. But this may be an idealized view. Although some prototypes are\\nbuilt as “throwaways,” others are evolutionary in the sense that the prototype slowly\\nevolves into the actual system.\\nBoth stakeholders and software engineers like the prototyping paradigm. Users\\nget a feel for the actual system, and developers get to build something immediately.\\nYet, prototyping can be problematic for the following reasons:\\n1. Stakeholders see what appears to be a working version of the software,\\nunaware that the prototype is held together haphazardly, unaware that in the\\nrush to get it working you haven’t considered overall software quality or\\nlong-term maintainability. When informed that the product must be rebuilt so\\nthat high levels of quality can be maintained, stakeholders cry foul and\\ndemand that “a few fixes” be applied to make the prototype a working\\nproduct. Too often, software development management relents.\\n2. As a software engineer, you often make implementation compromises in\\norder to get a prototype working quickly. An inappropriate operating system\\nor programming language may be used simply because it is available and\\nknown; an inefficient algorithm may be implemented simply to demonstrate\\ncapability. After a time, you may become comfortable with these choices and\\nforget all the reasons why they were inappropriate.

Boehm [Boe01a] describes the model in the following manner:\\nThe spiral development model is a risk-driven process model generator that is used to\\nguide multi-stakeholder concurrent engineering of software intensive systems.

The\\nother is a set of anchor point milestones for ensuring stakeholder commitment to feasible\\nand mutually satisfactory system solutions.\\nUsing the spiral model, software is developed in a series of evolutionary releases.\\nDuring early iterations, the release might be a model or prototype.

These are summarized\\nby Nogueira and his colleagues [Nog00] : \\nDespite the unquestionable benefits of evolutionary software processes, we have some\\nconcerns. The first concern is that prototyping [and other more sophisticated evolution-\\nary processes] poses a problem to project planning because of the uncertain number of\\ncycles required to construct the product. Most project management and estimation tech-\\nniques are based on linear layouts of activities, so they do not fit completely. \\nSecond, evolutionary software processes do not establish the maximum speed of the\\nevolution. If the evolutions occur too fast, without a period of relaxation, it is certain that\\nthe process will fall into chaos. On the other hand if the speed is too slow then produc-\\ntivity could be affected . . .\\nCHAPTER 2 PROCESS MODELS 49\\n13 It is important to note, however, that being the first to reach a market is no guarantee of success.\\nIn fact, many very successful software products have been second or even third to reach the market\\n(learning from the mistakes of their predecessors).\\nuote:\\n“Every process in\\nyour organization\\nhas a customer,\\nand without a\\ncustomer a process\\nhas no purpose.”\\nV.

Ambiguity, incompleteness, and inconsis-\\ntency can be discovered and corrected more easily—not through ad hoc review, but\\nthrough the application of mathematical analysis. When formal methods are used\\nduring design, they serve as a basis for program verification and therefore enable\\nyou to discover and correct errors that might otherwise go undetected.\\nAlthough not a mainstream approach, the formal methods model offers the prom-\\nise of defect-free software. Yet, concern about its applicability in a business envi-\\nronment has been voiced:\\n• The development of formal models is currently quite time consuming and\\nexpensive.\\n• Because few software developers have the necessary background to apply\\nformal methods, extensive training is required.\\n• It is difficult to use the models as a communication mechanism for techni-\\ncally unsophisticated customers.\\nThese concerns notwithstanding, the formal methods approach has gained\\nadherents among software developers who must build safety-critical software \\nCHAPTER 2 PROCESS MODELS 51\\nIf formal\\nmethods can\\ndemonstrate\\nsoftware\\ncorrectness, why\\nis it they are not\\nwidely used?\\n?\\npre75977_ch02.qxd  11/27/08  3:21 PM  Page 51'),\n",

Aspectual requirements define\\nthose crosscutting concerns that have an impact across the software architecture.\\nAspect-oriented software development (AOSD), often referred to as aspect-oriented\\nprogramming (AOP), is a relatively new software engineering paradigm that provides\\na process and methodological approach for defining, specifying, designing, and con-\\nstructing aspects—“mechanisms beyond subroutines and inheritance for localizing\\nthe expression of a crosscutting concern” [Elr01].\\nGrundy [Gru02] provides further discussion of aspects in the context of what he\\ncalls aspect-oriented component engineering (AOCE):\\nAOCE uses a concept of horizontal slices through vertically-decomposed software com-\\nponents, called “aspects,” to characterize cross-cutting functional and non-functional\\nproperties of components. Common, systemic aspects include user interfaces, collabora-\\ntive work, distribution, persistency, memory management, transaction processing, secu-\\nrity, integrity and so on. Components may provide or require one or more “aspect details”\\nrelating to a particular aspect, such as a viewing mechanism, extensible affordance and\\ninterface kind (user interface aspects); event generation, transport and receiving\\n(distribution aspects); data store/retrieve and indexing (persistency aspects); authentica-\\ntion, encoding and access rights (security aspects); transaction atomicity, concurrency\\ncontrol and logging strategy (transaction aspects); and so on. Each aspect detail has a\\nnumber of properties, relating to functional and/or non-functional characteristics of the\\naspect detail.\\nA distinct aspect-oriented process has not yet matured. However, it is likely that\\nsuch a process will adopt characteristics of both evolutionary and concurrent\\nprocess models.

The Unified Process recognizes the importance of customer communi-\\ncation and streamlined methods for describing the customer’s view of a system\\n(the use case\\n18). It emphasizes the important role of software architecture and\\n“helps the architect focus on the right goals, such as understandability, reliance to\\nfuture changes, and reuse” [Jac99]. It suggests a process flow that is iterative and\\nincremental, providing the evolutionary feel that is essential in modern software\\ndevelopment.\\n2.5.1 A Brief History\\nDuring the early 1990s James Rumbaugh [Rum91], Grady Booch [Boo94], and Ivar\\nJacobson [Jac92] began working on a “unified method” that would combine the best\\nfeatures of each of their individual object-oriented analysis and design methods and\\nadopt additional features proposed by other experts (e.g., [Wir90]) in object-oriented\\nmodeling. The result was UML—a unified modeling language that contains a robust\\nnotation for the modeling and development of object-oriented systems. By 1997,\\nUML became a de facto industry standard for object-oriented software development.\\nUML is used throughout Part 2 of this book to represent both requirements and\\ndesign models. Appendix 1 presents an introductory tutorial for those who are unfa-\\nmiliar with basic UML notation and modeling rules. A comprehensive presentation\\nof UML is best left to textbooks dedicated to the subject. Recommended books are\\nlisted in Appendix 1.\\nUML provided the necessary technology to support object-oriented software engi-\\nneering practice, but it did not provide the process framework to guide project teams\\nin their application of the technology. Over the next few years, Jacobson, Rumbaugh,\\nand Booch developed the Unified Process, a framework for object-oriented software\\nengineering using UML. Today, the Unified Process (UP) and UML are widely used on\\nobject-oriented projects of all kinds. The iterative, incremental model proposed by the\\nUP can and should be adapted to meet specific project needs. \\n2.5.2 Phases of the Unified Process 19\\nEarlier in this chapter, I discussed five generic framework activities and argued that\\nthey may be used to describe any software process model. The Unified Process is no\\nexception. Figure 2.9 depicts the “phases” of the UP and relates them to the generic\\nactivities that have been discussed in Chapter 1 and earlier in this chapter. \\n54 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\n18 A use case (Chapter 5) is a text narrative or template that describes a system function or feature\\nfrom the user’s point of view. A use case is written by the user and serves as a basis for the creation\\nof a more comprehensive requirements model.\\n19 The Unified Process is sometimes called the Rational Unified Process (RUP) after the Rational Cor-\\nporation (subsequently acquired by IBM), an early contributor to the development and refinement\\nof the UP and a builder of complete environments (tools and technology) that support the process.\\npre75977_ch02.qxd  11/27/08  3:21 PM  Page 54'),\n",

Alternatively, the\\nteam itself can create its own process, and at the same time meet the narrower needs\\nof individuals and the broader needs of the organization. Watts Humphrey ([Hum97]\\nand [Hum00]) argues that it is possible to create a “personal software process”\\nand/or a “team software process.” Both require hard work, training, and coordina-\\ntion, but both are achievable.\\n22\\n2.6.1 Personal Software Process (PSP)\\nEvery developer uses some process to build computer software. The process may be\\nhaphazard or ad hoc; may change on a daily basis; may not be efficient, effective, or\\neven successful; but a “process” does exist. Watts Humphrey [Hum97] suggests that\\nin order to change an ineffective personal process, an individual must move through\\nfour phases, each requiring training and careful instrumentation. The Personal Soft-\\nware Process (PSP) emphasizes personal measurement of both the work product that\\nis produced and the resultant quality of the work product. In addition PSP makes the\\npractitioner responsible for project planning (e.g., estimating and scheduling) and\\nempowers the practitioner to control the quality of all software work products that\\nare developed. The PSP model defines five framework activities: \\nPlanning. This activity isolates requirements and develops both size and\\nresource estimates. In addition, a defect estimate (the number of defects\\nprojected for the work) is made. All metrics are recorded on worksheets or\\ntemplates. Finally, development tasks are identified and a project schedule is\\ncreated.\\nHigh-level design. External specifications for each component to be con-\\nstructed are developed and a component design is created. Prototypes are\\nbuilt when uncertainty exists. All issues are recorded and tracked.\\nHigh-level design review. Formal verification methods (Chapter 21) are\\napplied to uncover errors in the design. Metrics are maintained for all impor-\\ntant tasks and work results.\\nDevelopment. The component-level design is refined and reviewed. Code\\nis generated, reviewed, compiled, and tested. Metrics are maintained for all\\nimportant tasks and work results.\\nPostmortem.

However,\\nPSP has not been widely adopted throughout the industry. The reasons, sadly, have\\nmore to do with human nature and organizational inertia than they do with the\\nstrengths and weaknesses of the PSP approach.

The goal of TSP is to build a “self-\\ndirected” project team that organizes itself to produce high-quality software.\\nHumphrey [Hum98] defines the following objectives for TSP:\\n• Build self-directed teams that plan and track their work, establish goals, and\\nown their processes and plans. These can be pure software teams or inte-\\ngrated product teams (IPTs) of 3 to about 20 engineers. \\n• Show managers how to coach and motivate their teams and how to help\\nthem sustain peak performance. \\n• Accelerate software process improvement by making CMM23 Level 5\\nbehavior normal and expected. \\n• Provide improvement guidance to high-maturity organizations. \\n• Facilitate university teaching of industrial-grade team skills.\\nA self-directed team has a consistent understanding of its overall goals and objec-\\ntives; defines roles and responsibilities for each team member; tracks quantitative\\nproject data (about productivity and quality); identifies a team process that is appro-\\npriate for the project and a strategy for implementing the process; defines local stan-\\ndards that are applicable to the team’s software engineering work; continually\\nassesses risk and reacts to it; and tracks, manages, and reports project status.\\n58 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\nPSP emphasizes the\\nneed to record and\\nanalyze the types of\\nerrors you make, so\\nthat you can develop\\nstrategies to eliminate\\nthem.\\nTo form a self-directed\\nteam, you must collab-\\norate well internally\\nand communicate well\\nexternally.\\nWebRef\\nInformation on building\\nhigh-performance teams\\nusing TSP and PSP can\\nbe obtained at:\\nwww.sei.cmu\\n.edu/tsp/.\\n23 The Capability Maturity Model (CMM), a measure of the effectiveness of a software process, is\\ndiscussed in Chapter 30.\\npre75977_ch02.qxd  11/27/08  3:21 PM  Page 58'),\n",

The\\npostmortem sets the stage for process improvements.\\nTSP makes use of a wide variety of scripts, forms, and standards that serve to guide\\nteam members in their work. “Scripts” define specific process activities (i.e., project\\nlaunch, design, implementation, integration and system testing, postmortem) and other\\nmore detailed work functions (e.g., development planning, requirements development,\\nsoftware configuration management, unit test) that are part of the team process.\\nTSP recognizes that the best software teams are self-directed.\\n24 Team members\\nset project objectives, adapt the process to meet their needs, control the project\\nschedule, and through measurement and analysis of the metrics collected, work con-\\ntinually to improve the team’s approach to software engineering.\\nLike PSP, TSP is a rigorous approach to software engineering that provides dis-\\ntinct and quantifiable benefits in productivity and quality.

To accomplish this, process technology toolshave\\nbeen developed to help software organizations analyze their current process,\\norganize work tasks, control and monitor progress, and manage technical quality.\\nProcess technology tools allow a software organization to build an automated\\nmodel of the process framework, task sets, and umbrella activities discussed in\\nSection 2.1.

But an obsessive over-\\nreliance on process is also dangerous.

Thus, we have embraced\\nstructured programming languages (product) followed by structured analysis methods\\n(process) followed by data encapsulation (product) followed by the current emphasis\\non the Software Engineering Institute’s Software Development Capability Maturity \\nModel (process) [followed by object-oriented methods, followed by agile software\\ndevelopment].\\nWhile the natural tendency of a pendulum is to come to rest at a point midway be-\\ntween two extremes, the software community’s focus constantly shifts because new force\\nis applied when the last swing fails. These swings are harmful in and of themselves be-\\ncause they confuse the average software practitioner by radically changing what it means\\nto perform the job let alone perform it well. The swings also do not solve “the problem”\\nfor they are doomed to fail as long as product and process are treated as forming a\\ndichotomy instead of a duality.\\nThere is precedence in the scientific community to advance notions of duality when\\ncontradictions in observations cannot be fully explained by one competing theory or\\nanother.

Each of a variety of process models\\ncan be described by a different process flow—a description of how the framework\\nactivities, actions, and tasks are organized sequentially and chronologically. Process\\npatterns can be used to solve common problems that are encountered as part of the\\nsoftware process.\\nPrescriptive process models have been applied for many years in an effort to bring\\norder and structure to software development. Each of these models suggests a some-\\nwhat different process flow, but all perform the same set of generic framework\\nactivities: communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment.\\nSequential process models, such as the waterfall and V models, are the oldest\\nsoftware engineering paradigms. They suggest a linear process flow that is often in-\\nconsistent with modern realities (e.g., continuous change, evolving systems, tight\\ntime lines) in the software world. They do, however, have applicability in situations\\nwhere requirements are well defined and stable.\\nCHAPTER 2 PROCESS MODELS 61\\npre75977_ch02.qxd  11/27/08  3:21 PM  Page 61'),\n",

In some ways, that’s exactly what agile development is all about.\\nAlthough the underlying ideas that guide agile development have been with us for\\nmany years, it has been less than two decades since these ideas have crystallized\\ninto a “movement.” In essence, agile\\n1 methods were developed in an effort to over-\\ncome perceived and actual weaknesses in conventional software engineering. Agile\\ndevelopment can provide important benefits, but it is not applicable to all projects,\\nall products, all people, and all situations. It is also not antithetical to solid software\\nengineering practice and can be applied as an overriding philosophy for all software\\nwork.\\nIn the modern economy, it is often difficult or impossible to predict how a\\ncomputer-based system (e.g., a Web-based application) will evolve as time passes.\\nMarket conditions change rapidly, end-user needs evolve, and new competitive\\nthreats emerge without warning. In many situations, you won’t be able to define\\nrequirements fully before the project begins. You must be agile enough to respond to\\na fluid business environment.\\nFluidity implies change, and change is expensive. Particularly if it is uncontrolled\\nor poorly managed. One of the most compelling characteristics of the agile approach\\nis its ability to reduce the costs of change throughout the software process.\\nDoes this mean that a recognition of challenges posed by modern realities causes\\nyou to discard valuable software engineering principles, concepts, methods, and\\ntools? Absolutely not! Like all engineering disciplines, software engineering contin-\\nues to evolve. It can be adapted easily to meet the challenges posed by a demand for\\nagility.\\nIn a thought-provoking book on agile software development, Alistair Cockburn\\n[Coc02] argues that the prescriptive process models introduced in Chapter 2 have a\\nmajor failing: they forget the frailties of the people who build computer software.Software\\nengineers are not robots. They exhibit great variation in working styles; significant dif-\\nferences in skill level, creativity, orderliness, consistency, and spontaneity. Some com-\\nmunicate well in written form, others do not. Cockburn argues that process models\\ncan “deal with people’s common weaknesses with [either] discipline or tolerance” and\\nthat most prescriptive process models choose discipline. He states: “Because consis-\\ntency in action is a human weakness, high discipline methodologies are fragile.”\\nIf process models are to work, they must provide a realistic mechanism for en-\\ncouraging the discipline that is necessary, or they must be characterized in a man-\\nner that shows “tolerance” for the people who do software engineering work.\\nInvariably, tolerant practices are easier for software people to adopt and sustain, but\\n(as Cockburn admits) they may be less productive.

Ivar Jacobson\\n[Jac02a] provides a useful discussion:\\nAgility has become today’s buzzword when describing a modern software process. Every-\\none is agile. An agile team is a nimble team able to appropriately respond to changes.\\nChange is what software development is very much about. Changes in the software be-\\ning built, changes to the team members, changes because of new technology, changes of\\nall kinds that may have an impact on the product they build or the project that creates the\\nproduct. Support for changes should be built-in everything we do in software, something\\nwe embrace because it is the heart and soul of software. An agile team recognizes that\\nsoftware is developed by individuals working in teams and that the skills of these people,\\ntheir ability to collaborate is at the core for the success of the project.\\nIn Jacobson’s view, the pervasiveness of change is the primary driver for agility. Soft-\\nware engineers must be quick on their feet if they are to accommodate the rapid\\nchanges that Jacobson describes.\\nBut agility is more than an effective response to change. It also encompasses the\\nphilosophy espoused in the manifesto noted at the beginning of this chapter. It\\nencourages team structures and attitudes that make communication (among team\\nmembers, between technologists and business people, between software engineers\\nand their managers) more facile. It emphasizes rapid delivery of operational soft-\\nware and de-emphasizes the importance of intermediate work products (not always\\na good thing); it adopts the customer as a part of the development team and works\\nto eliminate the “us and them” attitude that continues to pervade many software\\nprojects; it recognizes that planning in an uncertain world has its limits and that a\\nproject plan must be flexible.\\nAgility can be applied to any software process. However, to accomplish this, it is\\nessential that the process be designed in a way that allows the project team to adapt\\ntasks and to streamline them, conduct planning in a way that understands the fluid-\\nity of an agile development approach, eliminate all but the most essential work prod-\\nucts and keep them lean, and emphasize an incremental delivery strategy that gets\\nworking software to the customer as rapidly as feasible for the product type and\\noperational environment.\\n3.2 A GILITY AND THE COST OF CHANGE\\nThe conventional wisdom in software development (supported by decades of expe-\\nrience) is that the cost of change increases nonlinearly as a project progresses\\n(Figure 3.1, solid black curve). It is relatively easy to accommodate a change when a\\nsoftware team is gathering requirements (early in a project). A usage scenario might\\nhave to be modified, a list of functions may be extended, or a written specification\\ncan be edited. The costs of doing this work are minimal, and the time required will\\nCHAPTER 3 AGILE DEVELOPMENT 67\\nDon’t make the\\nmistake of assuming\\nthat agility gives you\\nlicense to hack out\\nsolutions.

But what if we fast-forward a num-\\nber of months? The team is in the middle of validation testing (something that occurs\\nrelatively late in the project), and an important stakeholder is requesting a major\\nfunctional change. The change requires a modification to the architectural design of\\nthe software, the design and construction of three new components, modifications\\nto another five components, the design of new tests, and so on. Costs escalate\\nquickly, and the time and cost required to ensure that the change is made without\\nunintended side effects is nontrivial.\\nProponents of agility (e.g., [Bec00], [Amb04]) argue that a well-designed agile\\nprocess “flattens” the cost of change curve (Figure 3.1, shaded, solid curve), allowing\\na software team to accommodate changes late in a software project without dramatic\\ncost and time impact. You’ve already learned that the agile process encompasses in-\\ncremental delivery. When incremental delivery is coupled with other agile practices\\nsuch as continuous unit testing and pair programming (discussed later in this chap-\\nter), the cost of making a change is attenuated. Although debate about the degree to\\nwhich the cost curve flattens is ongoing, there is evidence [Coc01a] to suggest that a\\nsignificant reduction in the cost of change can be achieved.\\n3.3 W HAT ISA N AGILE PROCESS ?\\nAny agile software process is characterized in a manner that addresses a number of\\nkey assumptions [Fow02] about the majority of software projects: \\n1.

For many types of software, design and construction are interleaved. That is,\\nboth activities should be performed in tandem so that design models are\\nproven as they are created. It is difficult to predict how much design is\\nnecessary before construction is used to prove the design.\\n3. Analysis, design, construction, and testing are not as predictable (from a\\nplanning point of view) as we might like.\\nGiven these three assumptions, an important question arises: How do we create a\\nprocess that can manage unpredictability? The answer, as I have already noted, lies\\nin process adaptability (to rapidly changing project and technical conditions). An\\nagile process, therefore, must be adaptable.\\nBut continual adaptation without forward progress accomplishes little. Therefore,\\nan agile software process must adapt incrementally.To accomplish incremental adap-\\ntation, an agile team requires customer feedback (so that the appropriate adaptations\\ncan be made). An effective catalyst for customer feedback is an operational prototype\\nor a portion of an operational system. Hence, an incremental development strategy\\nshould be instituted. Software increments(executable prototypes or portions of an op-\\nerational system) must be delivered in short time periods so that adaptation keeps pace\\nwith change (unpredictability). This iterative approach enables the customer to evalu-\\nate the software increment regularly, provide necessary feedback to the software team,\\nand influence the process adaptations that are made to accommodate the feedback.\\n3.3.1 Agility Principles\\nThe Agile Alliance (see [Agi03], [Fow01]) defines 12 agility principles for those who\\nwant to achieve agility: \\n1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous\\ndelivery of valuable software.\\n2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes\\nharness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.\\n3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of\\nmonths, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\\n4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the\\nproject.\\n5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and\\nsupport they need, and trust them to get the job done.\\n6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and\\nwithin a development team is face-to-face conversation.\\n7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.\\n8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers,\\nand users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\\nCHAPTER 3 AGILE DEVELOPMENT 69\\nWebRef\\nA comprehensive\\ncollection of articles on\\nthe agile process \\ncan be found at\\nwww.aanpo.org/\\narticles/index.\\nAlthough agile\\nprocesses embrace\\nchange, it is still\\nimportant to examine\\nthe reasons for\\nchange.\\nWorking software is\\nimportant, but don’t\\nforget that it must also\\nexhibit a variety of\\nquality attributes\\nincluding reliability,\\nusability, and \\nmaintainability.\\npre75977_ch03.qxd  11/27/08  3:24 PM  Page 69'),\n",

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self–\\norganizing teams.\\n12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then\\ntunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\\nNot every agile process model applies these 12 principles with equal weight, and\\nsome models choose to ignore (or at least downplay) the importance of one or more\\nof the principles. However, the principles define an agile spirit that is maintained in\\neach of the process models presented in this chapter.\\n3.3.2 The Politics of Agile Development\\nThere is considerable debate (sometimes strident) about the benefits and applicabil-\\nity of agile software development as opposed to more conventional software engi-\\nneering processes. Jim Highsmith [Hig02a] (facetiously) states the extremes when he\\ncharacterizes the feeling of the pro-agility camp (“agilists”). “Traditional methodolo-\\ngists are a bunch of stick-in-the-muds who’d rather produce flawless documentation\\nthan a working system that meets business needs.” As a counterpoint, he states\\n(again, facetiously) the position of the traditional software engineering camp: “Light-\\nweight, er, ‘agile’ methodologists are a bunch of glorified hackers who are going to\\nbe in for a heck of a surprise when they try to scale up their toys into enterprise-wide\\nsoftware.”\\nLike all software technology arguments, this methodology debate risks degener-\\nating into a religious war. If warfare breaks out, rational thought disappears and\\nbeliefs rather than facts guide decision making.\\nNo one is against agility. The real question is: What is the best way to achieve it?\\nAs important, how do you build software that meets customers’ needs today and\\nexhibits the quality characteristics that will enable it to be extended and scaled to\\nmeet customers’ needs over the long term?\\nThere are no absolute answers to either of these questions. Even within the agile\\nschool itself, there are many proposed process models (Section 3.4), each with a\\nsubtly different approach to the agility problem. Within each model there is a set of\\n“ideas” (agilists are loath to call them “work tasks”) that represent a significant\\ndeparture from traditional software engineering. And yet, many agile concepts are\\nsimply adaptations of good software engineering concepts. Bottom line: there is\\nmuch that can be gained by considering the best of both schools and virtually\\nnothing to be gained by denigrating either approach.\\nIf you have further interest, see [Hig01], [Hig02a], and [DeM02] for an entertain-\\ning summary of other important technical and political issues.\\n70 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\nYou don’t have to\\nchoose between agility\\nand software engi-\\nneering.

In an agile development (as well as software engineering)\\ncontext, “competence” encompasses innate talent, specific software-related\\nskills, and overall knowledge of the process that the team has chosen to\\napply. Skill and knowledge of process can and should be taught to all people\\nwho serve as agile team members.\\nCommon focus. Although members of the agile team may perform differ-\\nent tasks and bring different skills to the project, all should be focused on one\\ngoal—to deliver a working software increment to the customer within the\\ntime promised. To achieve this goal, the team will also focus on continual\\nadaptations (small and large) that will make the process fit the needs of the\\nteam.\\nCollaboration. Software engineering (regardless of process) is about as-\\nsessing, analyzing, and using information that is communicated to the soft-\\nware team; creating information that will help all stakeholders understand\\nthe work of the team; and building information (computer software and rele-\\nvant databases) that provides business value for the customer. To accomplish\\nthese tasks, team members must collaborate—with one another and all other\\nstakeholders.\\nDecision-making ability. Any good software team (including agile teams)\\nmust be allowed the freedom to control its own destiny. This implies that the\\nteam is given autonomy—decision-making authority for both technical and\\nproject issues.\\nFuzzy problem-solving ability.

The agile team must become what DeMarco\\nand Lister [DeM98] call a “jelled” team (Chapter 24). A jelled team exhibits\\nthe trust and respect that are necessary to make them “so strongly knit that\\nthe whole is greater than the sum of the parts.” [DeM98]\\nSelf-organization. In the context of agile development, self-organization\\nimplies three things: (1) the agile team organizes itself for the work to be\\ndone, (2) the team organizes the process to best accommodate its local envi-\\nronment, (3) the team organizes the work schedule to best achieve delivery\\nof the software increment. Self-organization has a number of technical bene-\\nfits, but more importantly, it serves to improve collaboration and boost team\\nmorale. In essence, the team serves as its own management. Ken Schwaber\\n[Sch02] addresses these issues when he writes: “The team selects how much\\nwork it believes it can perform within the iteration, and the team commits to\\nthe work. Nothing demotivates a team as much as someone else making\\ncommitments for it. Nothing motivates a team as much as accepting the\\nresponsibility for fulfilling commitments that it made itself.”\\n3.4 E XTREME PROGRAMMING (XP)\\nIn order to illustrate an agile process in a bit more detail, I’ll provide you with an\\noverview of Extreme Programming(XP), the most widely used approach to agile soft-\\nware development. Although early work on the ideas and methods associated with\\nXP occurred during the late 1980s, the seminal work on the subject has been written\\nby Kent Beck [Bec04a]. More recently, a variant of XP, called Industrial XP (IXP) has\\nbeen proposed [Ker05]. IXP refines XP and targets the agile process specifically for\\nuse within large organizations.\\n3.4.1 XP Values\\nBeck [Bec04a] defines a set of five valuesthat establish a foundation for all work per-\\nformed as part of XP—communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, and respect. Each\\nof these values is used as a driver for specific XP activities, actions, and tasks.\\nIn order to achieve effective communication between software engineers and\\nother stakeholders (e.g., to establish required features and functions for the soft-\\nware), XP emphasizes close, yet informal (verbal) collaboration between customers\\nand developers, the establishment of effective metaphors\\n3 for communicating\\nimportant concepts, continuous feedback, and the avoidance of voluminous docu-\\nmentation as a communication medium.\\n72 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\nA self-organizing team\\nis in control of the\\nwork it performs. The\\nteam makes its own\\ncommitments and\\ndefines plans to\\nachieve them.\\n3 In the XP context, a metaphor is “a story that everyone—customers, programmers, and managers—\\ncan tell about how the system works” [Bec04a].\\npre75977_ch03.qxd  11/27/08  3:24 PM  Page 72'),\n",

The intent is to create a simple design that can be\\neasily implemented in code). If the design must be improved, it can be refactored4 at\\na later time.\\nFeedback is derived from three sources: the implemented software itself, the\\ncustomer, and other software team members. By designing and implementing an\\neffective testing strategy (Chapters 17 through 20), the software (via test results) pro-\\nvides the agile team with feedback. XP makes use of the unit test as its primary test-\\ning tactic. As each class is developed, the team develops a unit test to exercise each\\noperation according to its specified functionality. As an increment is delivered to a\\ncustomer, the user stories or use cases (Chapter 5) that are implemented by the\\nincrement are used as a basis for acceptance tests. The degree to which the software\\nimplements the output, function, and behavior of the use case is a form of feedback.\\nFinally, as new requirements are derived as part of iterative planning, the team pro-\\nvides the customer with rapid feedback regarding cost and schedule impact.\\nBeck [Bec04a] argues that strict adherence to certain XP practices demands\\ncourage. A better word might be discipline. For example, there is often significant\\npressure to design for future requirements. Most software teams succumb, arguing\\nthat “designing for tomorrow” will save time and effort in the long run. An agile XP\\nteam must have the discipline (courage) to design for today, recognizing that future\\nrequirements may change dramatically, thereby demanding substantial rework of\\nthe design and implemented code.\\nBy following each of these values, the agile team inculcates respect among it\\nmembers, between other stakeholders and team members, and indirectly, for the\\nsoftware itself. As they achieve successful delivery of software increments, the team\\ndevelops growing respect for the XP process.\\n3.4.2 The XP Process\\nExtreme Programming uses an object-oriented approach (Appendix 2) as its pre-\\nferred development paradigm and encompasses a set of rules and practices that\\noccur within the context of four framework activities: planning, design, coding, and\\ntesting. Figure 3.2 illustrates the XP process and notes some of the key ideas and\\ntasks that are associated with each framework activity. Key XP activities are sum-\\nmarized in the paragraphs that follow.\\nPlanning.

Listening leads to the\\ncreation of a set of “stories” (also called user stories) that describe required output,\\nfeatures, and functionality for software to be built. Each story (similar to use cases\\ndescribed in Chapter 5) is written by the customer and is placed on an index card.\\nThe customer assigns a value (i.e., a priority) to the story based on the overall busi-\\nness value of the feature or function.\\n5 Members of the XP team then assess each\\nstory and assign a cost—measured in development weeks—to it. If the story is esti-\\nmated to require more than three development weeks, the customer is asked to split\\nthe story into smaller stories and the assignment of value and cost occurs again. It\\nis important to note that new stories can be written at any time.\\nCustomers and developers work together to decide how to group stories into the\\nnext release (the next software increment) to be developed by the XP team. Once a\\nbasic commitment (agreement on stories to be included, delivery date, and other\\nproject matters) is made for a release, the XP team orders the stories that will be de-\\nveloped in one of three ways: (1) all stories will be implemented immediately (within\\na few weeks), (2) the stories with highest value will be moved up in the schedule and\\nimplemented first, or (3) the riskiest stories will be moved up in the schedule and\\nimplemented first.\\nAfter the first project release (also called a software increment) has been deliv-\\nered, the XP team computes project velocity.

The XP team then reconsiders all\\nremaining releases and modifies its plans accordingly.\\nDesign. XP design rigorously follows the KIS (keep it simple) principle. A simple\\ndesign is always preferred over a more complex representation. In addition, the de-\\nsign provides implementation guidance for a story as it is written—nothing less,\\nnothing more. The design of extra functionality (because the developer assumes it\\nwill be required later) is discouraged.\\n6\\nXP encourages the use of CRC cards (Chapter 7) as an effective mechanism for\\nthinking about the software in an object-oriented context. CRC (class-responsibility-\\ncollaborator) cards identify and organize the object-oriented classes\\n7 that are rele-\\nvant to the current software increment. The XP team conducts the design exercise\\nusing a process similar to the one described in Chapter 8. The CRC cards are the only\\ndesign work product produced as part of the XP process.\\nIf a difficult design problem is encountered as part of the design of a story, XP rec-\\nommends the immediate creation of an operational prototype of that portion of the\\ndesign. Called a spike solution, the design prototype is implemented and evaluated.\\nThe intent is to lower risk when true implementation starts and to validate the orig-\\ninal estimates for the story containing the design problem.\\nIn the preceding section, we noted that XP encourages refactoring—a construction\\ntechnique that is also a method for design optimization. Fowler [Fow00] describes\\nrefactoring in the following manner:\\nRefactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not\\nalter the external behavior of the code yet improves the internal structure. It is a disci-\\nplined way to clean up code [and modify/simplify the internal design] that minimizes the\\nchances of introducing bugs. In essence, when you refactor you are improving the design\\nof the code after it has been written.\\nBecause XP design uses virtually no notation and produces few, if any, work prod-\\nucts other than CRC cards and spike solutions, design is viewed as a transient arti-\\nfact that can and should be continually modified as construction proceeds. The intent\\nof refactoring is to control these modifications by suggesting small design changes\\nCHAPTER 3 AGILE DEVELOPMENT 75\\nProject velocity is a\\nsubtle measure of\\nteam productivity.\\n6 These design guidelines should be followed in every software engineering method, although there\\nare times when sophisticated design notation and terminology may get in the way of simplicity.\\n7 Object-oriented classes are discussed in Appendix 2, in Chapter 8, and throughout Part 2 of this\\nbook.\\nXP deemphasizes the\\nimportance of design.\\nNot everyone agrees.\\nIn fact, there are times\\nwhen design should be\\nemphasized.\\nWebRef\\nRefactoring techniques\\nand tools can be\\nfound at:\\nwww.refactoring\\n.com.\\npre75977_ch03.qxd  11/27/08  3:24 PM  Page 75'),\n",

It should be noted, however, that\\nthe effort required for refactoring can grow dramatically as the size of an application\\ngrows.\\nA central notion in XP is that design occurs both before and after coding com-\\nmences. Refactoring means that design occurs continuously as the system is con-\\nstructed. In fact, the construction activity itself will provide the XP team with\\nguidance on how to improve the design.\\nCoding. After stories are developed and preliminary design work is done, the team\\ndoes not move to code, but rather develops a series of unit tests that will exercise\\neach of the stories that is to be included in the current release (software increment).\\n8\\nOnce the unit test9 has been created, the developer is better able to focus on what\\nmust be implemented to pass the test. Nothing extraneous is added (KIS). Once the\\ncode is complete, it can be unit-tested immediately, thereby providing instantaneous\\nfeedback to the developers.\\nA key concept during the coding activity (and one of the most talked about aspects\\nof XP) is pair programming. XP recommends that two people work together at one\\ncomputer workstation to create code for a story. This provides a mechanism for real-\\ntime problem solving (two heads are often better than one) and real-time quality as-\\nsurance (the code is reviewed as it is created). It also keeps the developers focused\\non the problem at hand. In practice, each person takes on a slightly different role. For\\nexample, one person might think about the coding details of a particular portion of\\nthe design while the other ensures that coding standards (a required part of XP) are\\nbeing followed or that the code for the story will satisfy the unit test that has been\\ndeveloped to validate the code against the story.\\nAs pair programmers complete their work, the code they develop is integrated\\nwith the work of others. In some cases this is performed on a daily basis by an inte-\\ngration team. In other cases, the pair programmers have integration responsibility.\\nThis “continuous integration” strategy helps to avoid compatibility and interfacing\\nproblems and provides a “smoke testing” environment (Chapter 17) that helps to\\nuncover errors early.\\nTesting. I have already noted that the creation of unit tests before coding com-\\nmences is a key element of the XP approach. The unit tests that are created should\\nbe implemented using a framework that enables them to be automated (hence, they\\ncan be executed easily and repeatedly). This encourages a regression testing strat-\\negy (Chapter 17) whenever code is modified (which is often, given the XP refactor-\\ning philosophy).\\n76 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\nRefactoring improves\\nthe internal structure of\\na design (or source\\ncode) without\\nchanging its external\\nfunctionality or\\nbehavior.\\nWebRef\\nUseful information on\\nXP can be obtained \\nat www\\n.xprogramming.\\ncom.\\n8 This approach is analogous to knowing the exam questions before you begin to study.

Wells [Wel99] states: “Fixing small problems every\\nfew hours takes less time than fixing huge problems just before the deadline.”\\nXP acceptance tests, also called customer tests, are specified by the customer and\\nfocus on overall system features and functionality that are visible and reviewable by\\nthe customer. Acceptance tests are derived from user stories that have been imple-\\nmented as part of a software release.\\n3.4.3 Industrial XP\\nJoshua Kerievsky [Ker05] describes Industrial Extreme Programming (IXP) in the fol-\\nlowing manner: “IXP is an organic evolution of XP. It is imbued with XP’s minimal-\\nist, customer-centric, test-driven spirit. IXP differs most from the original XP in its\\ngreater inclusion of management, its expanded role for customers, and its upgraded\\ntechnical practices.” IXP incorporates six new practices that are designed to help\\nensure that an XP project works successfully for significant projects within a large\\norganization.\\nReadiness assessment. Prior to the initiation of an IXP project, the organ-\\nization should conduct a readiness assessment. The assessment ascertains\\nwhether (1) an appropriate development environment exists to support IXP,\\n(2) the team will be populated by the proper set of stakeholders, (3) the or-\\nganization has a distinct quality program and supports continuous improve-\\nment, (4) the organizational culture will support the new values of an agile\\nteam, and (5) the broader project community will be populated appropriately.\\nProject community. Classic XP suggests that the right people be used to\\npopulate the agile team to ensure success. The implication is that people on\\nthe team must be well-trained, adaptable and skilled, and have the proper\\ntemperament to contribute to a self-organizing team. When XP is to be\\napplied for a significant project in a large organization, the concept of the\\n“team” should morph into that of a community. A community may have a\\ntechnologist and customers who are central to the success of a project as\\nwell as many other stakeholders (e.g., legal staff, quality auditors, manufac-\\nturing or sales types) who “are often at the periphery of an IXP project yet\\nthey may play important roles on the project” [Ker05]. In IXP, the community\\nmembers and their roles should be explicitly defined and mechanisms for\\ncommunication and coordination between community members should be\\nestablished.\\nProject chartering. The IXP team assesses the project itself to determine\\nwhether an appropriate business justification for the project exists and\\nwhether the project will further the overall goals and objectives of the\\nCHAPTER 3 AGILE DEVELOPMENT 77\\nXP acceptance tests\\nare derived from user\\nstories.\\nWhat new\\npractices are\\nappended to XP\\nto create IXP?\\n?\\nuote:\\n“Ability is what\\nyou’re capable of\\ndoing.

Chartering also examines the context of the project to deter-\\nmine how it complements, extends, or replaces existing systems or\\nprocesses.\\nTest-driven management. An IXP project requires measurable criteria for\\nassessing the state of the project and the progress that has been made to\\ndate. Test-driven management establishes a series of measurable “destina-\\ntions” [Ker05] and then defines mechanisms for determining whether or not\\nthese destinations have been reached.\\nRetrospectives. An IXP team conducts a specialized technical review\\n(Chapter 15) after a software increment is delivered. Called a retrospective,\\nthe review examines “issues, events, and lessons-learned” [Ker05] across a\\nsoftware increment and/or the entire software release. The intent is to\\nimprove the IXP process.\\nContinuous learning. Because learning is a vital part of continuous\\nprocess improvement, members of the XP team are encouraged (and possi-\\nbly, incented) to learn new methods and techniques that can lead to a higher-\\nquality product.\\nIn addition to the six new practices discussed, IXP modifies a number of existing\\nXP practices. Story-driven development (SDD) insists that stories for acceptance tests\\nbe written before a single line of code is generated. Domain-driven design (DDD) is\\nan improvement on the “system metaphor” concept used in XP. DDD [Eva03] sug-\\ngests the evolutionary creation of a domain model that “accurately represents how\\ndomain experts think about their subject” [Ker05]. Pairing extends the XP pair-\\nprogramming concept to include managers and other stakeholders. The intent is to\\nimprove knowledge sharing among XP team members who may not be directly in-\\nvolved in technical development. Iterative usability discourages front-loaded inter-\\nface design in favor of usability design that evolves as software increments are\\ndelivered and users’ interaction with the software is studied.\\nIXP makes smaller modifications to other XP practices and redefines certain roles\\nand responsibilities to make them more amenable to significant projects for large\\norganizations.

Extreme Programming has done both. In an interesting book\\nthat examines the efficacy of XP, Stephens and Rosenberg [Ste03] argue that many\\nXP practices are worthwhile, but others have been overhyped, and a few are prob-\\nlematic. The authors suggest that the codependent nature of XP practices are both\\nits strength and its weakness. Because many organizations adopt only a subset of XP\\npractices, they weaken the efficacy of the entire process.

Among the issues that continue to trouble some\\ncritics of XP are:10\\n• Requirements volatility. Because the customer is an active member of the XP\\nteam, changes to requirements are requested informally. As a consequence,\\nthe scope of the project can change and earlier work may have to be\\nmodified to accommodate current needs. Proponents argue that this happens\\nregardless of the process that is applied and that XP provides mechanisms for\\ncontrolling scope creep.\\n• Conflicting customer needs. Many projects have multiple customers, each with\\nhis own set of needs. In XP, the team itself is tasked with assimilating the\\nneeds of different customers, a job that may be beyond their scope of\\nauthority.\\n• Requirements are expressed informally. User stories and acceptance tests are\\nthe only explicit manifestation of requirements in XP. Critics argue that a\\nmore formal model or specification is often needed to ensure that omissions,\\ninconsistencies, and errors are uncovered before the system is built. Propo-\\nnents counter that the changing nature of requirements makes such models\\nand specification obsolete almost as soon as they are developed.\\n• Lack of formal design. XP deemphasizes the need for architectural design and\\nin many instances, suggests that design of all kinds should be relatively\\ninformal. Critics argue that when complex systems are built, design must be\\nemphasized to ensure that the overall structure of the software will exhibit\\nquality and maintainability. XP proponents suggest that the incremental\\nnature of the XP process limits complexity (simplicity is a core value) and\\ntherefore reduces the need for extensive design.\\nYou should note that every software process has flaws and that many software or-\\nganizations have used XP successfully.

Among the most common are:\\n• Adaptive Software Development (ASD)\\n• Scrum\\n• Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)\\n80 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\nDoug: Sure Jamie, what’s up?\\nJamie: We’ve been thinking about our process\\ndiscussion yesterday . . . you know, what process we’re\\ngoing to choose for this new SafeHome project.\\nDoug: And?\\nVinod: I was talking to a friend at another company,\\nand he was telling me about Extreme Programming. It’s\\nan agile process model . . . heard of it?\\nDoug: Yeah, some good, some bad.\\nJamie: Well, it sounds pretty good to us. Lets you\\ndevelop software really fast, uses something called pair\\nprogramming to do real-time quality checks . . . it’s pretty\\ncool, I think.\\nDoug: It does have a lot of really good ideas. I like the\\npair-programming concept, for instance, and the idea\\nthat stakeholders should be part of the team.\\nJamie: Huh? You mean that marketing will work on the\\nproject team with us?\\nDoug (nodding): They’re a stakeholder, aren’t they?\\nJamie: Jeez . . . they’ll be requesting changes every five\\nminutes.\\nVinod: Not necessarily. My friend said that there are\\nways to “embrace” changes during an XP project.\\nDoug: So you guys think we should use XP?\\nJamie: It’s definitely worth considering.\\nDoug: I agree. And even if we choose an incremental\\nmodel as our approach, there’s no reason why we can’t\\nincorporate much of what XP has to offer.\\nVinod: Doug, before you said “some good, some bad.”\\nWhat was the “bad”?\\nDoug: The thing I don’t like is the way XP downplays\\nanalysis and design . . . sort of says that writing code is\\nwhere the action is . . . \\n(The team members look at one another and smile.)\\nDoug: So you agree with the XP approach?\\nJamie (speaking for both): Writing code is what\\nwe do, Boss!\\nDoug (laughing): True, but I’d like to see you spend a\\nlittle less time coding and then recoding and a little more\\ntime analyzing what has to be done and designing a\\nsolution that works.\\nVinod: Maybe we can have it both ways, agility with a\\nlittle discipline.\\nDoug: I think we can, Vinod. In fact, I’m sure of it.\\nuote:\\n“Our profession\\ngoes through\\nmethodologies like\\na 14-year-old goes\\nthrough clothing.”\\nStephen\\nHawrysh and\\nJim Ruprecht\\n11 This is not a bad thing. Before one or more models or methods are accepted as a de facto standard,\\nall must contend for the hearts and minds of software engineers.

Adaptive cycle planning uses project initiation information—the customer’s\\nmission statement, project constraints (e.g., delivery dates or user descriptions), and\\nbasic requirements—to define the set of release cycles (software increments) that\\nwill be required for the project.\\nNo matter how complete and farsighted the cycle plan, it will invariably change.\\nBased on information obtained at the completion of the first cycle, the plan is re-\\nviewed and adjusted so that planned work better fits the reality in which an ASD\\nteam is working.\\nMotivated people use collaboration in a way that multiplies their talent and cre-\\native output beyond their absolute numbers. This approach is a recurring theme in\\nall agile methods. But collaboration is not easy. It encompasses communication and\\nteamwork, but it also emphasizes individualism, because individual creativity plays\\nan important role in collaborative thinking. It is, above all, a matter of trust. People\\nworking together must trust one another to (1) criticize without animosity, (2) assist\\nwithout resentment, (3) work as hard as or harder than they do, (4) have the skill set\\nto contribute to the work at hand, and (5) communicate problems or concerns in a\\nway that leads to effective action.\\nAs members of an ASD team begin to develop the components that are part of an\\nadaptive cycle, the emphasis is on “learning” as much as it is on progress toward\\na completed cycle. In fact, Highsmith [Hig00] argues that software developers often\\noverestimate their own understanding (of the technology, the process, and the proj-\\nect) and that learning will help them to improve their level of real understanding.\\nASD teams learn in three ways: focus groups (Chapter 5), technical reviews (Chap-\\nter 14), and project postmortems.\\nThe ASD philosophy has merit regardless of the process model that is used. ASD’s\\noverall emphasis on the dynamics of self-organizing teams, interpersonal collabo-\\nration, and individual and team learning yield software project teams that have a\\nmuch higher likelihood of success.\\n3.5.2 Scrum\\nScrum (the name is derived from an activity that occurs during a rugby match 13)i s\\nan agile software development method that was conceived by Jeff Sutherland and his\\ndevelopment team in the early 1990s.

The DSDM philosophy is borrowed from a mod-\\nified version of the Pareto principle—80 percent of an application can be delivered in\\n20 percent of the time it would take to deliver the complete (100 percent) application.\\nDSDM is an iterative software process in which each iteration follows the 80 per-\\ncent rule. That is, only enough work is required for each increment to facilitate\\nmovement to the next increment. The remaining detail can be completed later when\\nmore business requirements are known or changes have been requested and\\naccommodated.\\nThe DSDM Consortium (www.dsdm.org) is a worldwide group of member com-\\npanies that collectively take on the role of “keeper” of the method. The consortium\\nhas defined an agile process model, called the DSDM life cycle that defines three dif-\\nferent iterative cycles, preceded by two additional life cycle activities:\\nFeasibility study—establishes the basic business requirements and constraints\\nassociated with the application to be built and then assesses whether the applica-\\ntion is a viable candidate for the DSDM process.\\n84 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\nWebRef\\nUseful resources for\\nDSSD can be found at\\nwww.dsdm.org.\\npre75977_ch03.qxd  11/27/08  3:24 PM  Page 84'),\n",

(Note: All DSDM prototypes are in-\\ntended to evolve into the deliverable application.) The intent during this iterative\\ncycle is to gather additional requirements by eliciting feedback from users as they\\nexercise the prototype.\\nDesign and build iteration—revisits prototypes built during functional model\\niteration to ensure that each has been engineered in a manner that will enable it to\\nprovide operational business value for end users. In some cases, functional model\\niteration and design and build iteration occur concurrently.\\nImplementation—places the latest software increment (an “operationalized” pro-\\ntotype) into the operational environment.

The Crystal family is\\nactually a set of example agile processes that have been proven effective for differ-\\nent types of projects.

Stephen Palmer and John Felsing [Pal02] have extended and improved\\nCoad’s work, describing an adaptive, agile process that can be applied to moderately\\nsized and larger software projects.\\nLike other agile approaches, FDD adopts a philosophy that (1) emphasizes col-\\nlaboration among people on an FDD team; (2) manages problem and project\\ncomplexity using feature-based decomposition followed by the integration of\\nsoftware increments, and (3) communication of technical detail using verbal,\\ngraphical, and text-based means. FDD emphasizes software quality assurance\\nactivities by encouraging an incremental development strategy, the use of design\\nand code inspections, the application of software quality assurance audits (Chap-\\nter 16), the collection of metrics, and the use of patterns (for analysis, design, and\\nconstruction).\\nIn the context of FDD, a feature “is a client-valued function that can be imple-\\nmented in two weeks or less” [Coa99]. The emphasis on the definition of features\\nprovides the following benefits:\\n• Because features are small blocks of deliverable functionality, users can\\ndescribe them more easily; understand how they relate to one another more\\nreadily; and better review them for ambiguity, error, or omissions.\\n• Features can be organized into a hierarchical business-related grouping.\\n• Since a feature is the FDD deliverable software increment, the team develops\\noperational features every two weeks.\\n• Because features are small, their design and code representations are easier\\nto inspect effectively.\\n• Project planning, scheduling, and tracking are driven by the feature\\nhierarchy, rather than an arbitrarily adopted software engineering \\ntask set.\\nCoad and his colleagues [Coa99] suggest the following template for defining a\\nfeature:\\n<action> the <result> <by for of to> a(n) <object>\\nwhere an <object> is “a person, place, or thing (including roles, moments in time or\\nintervals of time, or catalog-entry-like descriptions).” Examples of features for an \\ne-commerce application might be:\\nAdd the product to shopping cart\\nDisplay the technical-specifications of the product\\nStore the shipping-information for the customer\\n86 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\nWebRef\\nA wide variety of\\narticles and\\npresentations on FDD\\ncan be found at:\\nwww.featuredrive\\nndevelopment\\n.com/.\\npre75977_ch03.qxd  11/27/08  3:24 PM  Page 86'),\n",

As projects grow in size and complexity,\\nad hoc project management is often inadequate. It is essential for developers, their\\nmanagers, and other stakeholders to understand project status—what accomplish-\\nments have been made and problems have been encountered. If deadline pressure\\nis significant, it is critical to determine if software increments (features) are properly\\nscheduled. To accomplish this, FDD defines six milestones during the design and\\nimplementation of a feature: “design walkthrough, design, design inspection, code,\\ncode inspection, promote to build” [Coa99].\\n3.5.6 Lean Software Development (LSD)\\nLean Software Development (LSD) has adapted the principles of lean manufacturing\\nto the world of software engineering. The lean principles that inspire the LSD process\\ncan be summarized ([Pop03], [Pop06a]) as eliminate waste, build quality in, create\\nknowledge, defer commitment, deliver fast, respect people, and optimize the whole.\\nEach of these principles can be adapted to the software process. For example,\\neliminate waste within the context of an agile software project can be interpreted\\nto mean [Das05]: (1) adding no extraneous features or functions, (2) assessing the\\ncost and schedule impact of any newly requested requirement, (3) removing any\\nsuperfluous process steps, (4) establishing mechanisms to improve the way team\\nmembers find information, (5) ensuring the testing finds as many errors as possible,\\nCHAPTER 3 AGILE DEVELOPMENT 87\\nDevelop\\nan\\nOverall\\nModel\\nBuild a\\nFeatures\\nList\\nPlan\\nBy\\nFeature\\nDesign\\nBy\\nFeature\\nBuild\\nBy\\nFeature\\n(more shape\\nthan content)\\nA list of features\\ngrouped into sets\\nand subject areas\\nA development plan\\nClass owners\\nFeature Set Owners\\nA design\\npackage\\n(sequences)\\nCompleted\\nclient-value\\nfunction\\nFIGURE 3.5\\nFeature Driven\\nDevelopment\\n[Coa99] (with\\npermission)\\npre75977_ch03.qxd  11/27/08  3:24 PM  Page 87'),\n",

The scope and complexity of such systems must be modeled so that\\n(1) all constituencies can better understand what needs to be accomplished, (2) the\\nproblem can be partitioned effectively among the people who must solve it, and\\n(3) quality can be assessed as the system is being engineered and built.\\nOver the past 30 years, a wide variety of software engineering modeling methods\\nand notation have been proposed for analysis and design (both architectural and\\ncomponent-level). These methods have merit, but they have proven to be difficult\\nto apply and challenging to sustain (over many projects). Part of the problem is the\\n“weight” of these modeling methods. By this I mean the volume of notation required,\\nthe degree of formalism suggested, the sheer size of the models for large projects,\\nand the difficulty in maintaining the model(s) as changes occur. Yet analysis and de-\\nsign modeling have substantial benefit for large projects—if for no other reason than\\nto make these projects intellectually manageable. Is there an agile approach to soft-\\nware engineering modeling that might provide an alternative?\\nAt “The Official Agile Modeling Site,” Scott Ambler [Amb02a] describes agile mod-\\neling (AM) in the following manner:\\nAgile Modeling (AM) is a practice-based methodology for effective modeling and documen-\\ntation of software-based systems. Simply put, Agile Modeling (AM) is a collection of values,\\nprinciples, and practices for modeling software that can be applied on a software develop-\\nment project in an effective and light-weight manner. Agile models are more effective than\\ntraditional models because they are just barely good, they don’t have to be perfect.\\nAgile modeling adopts all of the values that are consistent with the agile manifesto.\\nThe agile modeling philosophy recognizes that an agile team must have the courage\\nto make decisions that may cause it to reject a design and refactor. The team must\\nalso have the humility to recognize that technologists do not have all the answers and\\nthat business experts and other stakeholders should be respected and embraced.\\nAlthough AM suggests a wide array of “core” and “supplementary” modeling prin-\\nciples, those that make AM unique are [Amb02a]:\\nModel with a purpose. A developer who uses AM should have a specific\\ngoal (e.g., to communicate information to the customer or to help better un-\\nderstand some aspect of the software) in mind before creating the model.\\nOnce the goal for the model is identified, the type of notation to be used and\\nlevel of detail required will be more obvious.\\n88 PART ONE THE SOFTWARE PROCESS\\nWebRef\\nComprehensive\\ninformation on agile\\nmodeling can be found\\nat: www\\n.agilemodeling.com.\\nuote:\\n“I was in the drug\\nstore the other day\\ntrying to get a cold\\nmedication . . . not\\neasy.

By adopting the\\nclassic UP phased activities—inception, elaboration, construction, and transition—AUP\\nprovides a serial overlay (i.e., a linear sequence of software engineering activities)\\nthat enables a team to visualize the overall process flow for a software project. How-\\never, within each of the activities, the team iterates to achieve agility and to deliver\\nmeaningful software increments to end users as rapidly as possible. Each AUP iter-\\nation addresses the following activities [Amb06]: \\n• Modeling. UML representations of the business and problem domains are\\ncreated. However, to stay agile, these models should be “just barely good\\nenough” [Amb06] to allow the team to proceed.\\nCHAPTER 3 AGILE DEVELOPMENT 89\\n“Traveling light” is an\\nappropriate philosophy\\nfor all software engi-\\nneering work.

However, Alistair Cockburn [Coc04] sug-\\ngests that tools can have a benefit and that “agile teams stress using tools that per-\\nmit the rapid flow of understanding. Some of those tools are social, starting even at\\nthe hiring stage. Some tools are technological, helping distributed teams simulate\\nbeing physically present. Many tools are physical, allowing people to manipulate\\nthem in workshops.”\\nBecause acquiring the right people (hiring), team collaboration, stakeholder com-\\nmunication, and indirect management are key elements in virtually all agile process\\nmodels, Cockburn argues that “tools” that address these issues are critical success\\nfactors for agility. For example, a hiring “tool” might be the requirement to have a\\nprospective team member spend a few hours pair programming with an existing\\nmember of the team. The “fit” can be assessed immediately.\\nCollaborative and communication “tools” are generally low tech and incorporate\\nany mechanism (“physical proximity, whiteboards, poster sheets, index cards, and\\nsticky notes” [Coc04]) that provides information and coordination among agile de-\\nvelopers. Active communication is achieved via the team dynamics (e.g., pair pro-\\ngramming), while passive communication is achieved by “information radiators”\\n(e.g., a flat panel display that presents the overall status of different components of\\nan increment). Project management tools deemphasize the Gantt chart and replace\\nit with earned value charts or “graphs of tests created versus passed . . . other agile\\ntools are used to optimize the environment in which the agile team works (e.g., more\\nefficient meeting areas), improve the team culture by nurturing social interactions\\n(e.g., collocated teams), physical devices (e.g., electronic whiteboards), and process\\nenhancement (e.g., pair programming or time-boxing)” [Coc04].\\nAre any of these things really tools? They are, if they facilitate the work performed\\nby an agile team member and enhance the quality of the end product.\\n3.7 S UMMARY\\nIn a modern economy, market conditions change rapidly, customer and end-user\\nneeds evolve, and new competitive threats emerge without warning. Practitioners\\nmust approach software engineering in a manner that allows them to remain agile—\\nto define maneuverable, adaptive, lean processes that can accommodate the needs\\nof modern business.\\nAn agile philosophy for software engineering stresses four key issues: the impor-\\ntance of self-organizing teams that have control over the work they perform, com-\\nmunication and collaboration between team members and between practitioners\\nand their customers, a recognition that change represents an opportunity, and\\nCHAPTER 3 AGILE DEVELOPMENT 91\\nThe “tool set” that\\nsupports agile\\nprocesses focuses\\nmore on people issues\\nthan it does on\\ntechnology issues.\\npre75977_ch03.qxd  11/27/08  3:24 PM  Page 91'),\n",

Agile process\\nmodels have been designed to address each of these issues.\\nExtreme programming (XP) is the most widely used agile process. Organized as\\nfour framework activities—planning, design, coding, and testing—XP suggests a\\nnumber of innovative and powerful techniques that allow an agile team to create\\nfrequent software releases that deliver features and functionality that have been de-\\nscribed and then prioritized by stakeholders.\\nOther agile process models also stress human collaboration and team self-\\norganization, but define their own framework activities and select different points of\\nemphasis. For example, ASD uses an iterative process that incorporates adaptive\\ncycle planning, relatively rigorous requirement gathering methods, and an iterative\\ndevelopment cycle that incorporates customer focus groups and formal technical re-\\nviews as real-time feedback mechanisms. Scrum emphasizes the use of a set of soft-\\nware process patterns that have proven effective for projects with tight time lines,\\nchanging requirements, and business criticality. Each process pattern defines a set\\nof development tasks and allows the Scrum team to construct a process that is\\nadapted to the needs of the project. The Dynamic Systems Development Method\\n(DSDM) advocates the use of time-box scheduling and suggests that only enough\\nwork is required for each software increment to facilitate movement to the next\\nincrement. Crystal is a family of agile process models that can be adopted to the spe-\\ncific characteristics of a project.\\nFeature Driven Development (FDD) is somewhat more “formal” than other agile\\nmethods, but still maintains agility by focusing the project team on the development\\nof features—a client-valued function that can be implemented in two weeks or less.\\nLean Software Development (LSD) has adapted the principles of lean manufacturing\\nto the world of software engineering. Agile modeling (AM) suggests that modeling is\\nessential for all systems, but that the complexity, type, and size of the model must be\\ntuned to the software to be built. The Agile Unified Process (AUP) adopts a “serial in\\nthe large” and “iterative in the small” philosophy for building software.\\nPROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER\\n3.1.

Knowledge of specific technology details is necessary to perform computer program-\\nming. If someone assigns you to write a program in C/H11001/H11001, you have to know something\\nabout C/H11001/H11001to get your program to work.\\nYou often hear people say that software development knowledge has a 3-year \\nhalf-life: half of what you need to know today will be obsolete within 3 years. In the\\ndomain of technology-related knowledge, that’s probably about right. But there is\\nanother kind of software development knowledge—a kind that I think of as “software\\nengineering principles”—that does not have a three-year half-life. These software engi-\\nneering principles are likely to serve a professional programmer throughout his or her\\ncareer.\\nMcConnell goes on to argue that the body of software engineering knowledge\\n(circa the year 2000) had evolved to a “stable core” that he estimated represented\\nabout “75 percent of the knowledge needed to develop a complex system.” But what\\nresides within this stable core?\\nAs McConnell indicates, core principles—the elemental ideas that guide software\\nengineers in the work that they do—now provide a foundation from which software\\nengineering models, methods, and tools can be applied and evaluated.\\n1 Some writers argue for one of these terms to the exclusion of the others.

At the level of practice, core principles establish a collection of values and\\nrules that serve as a guide as you analyze a problem, design a solution, implement\\nand test the solution, and ultimately deploy the software in the user community.\\nIn Chapter 1, I identified a set of general principles that span software engineering\\nprocess and practice: (1) provide value to end users, (2) keep it simple, (3) maintain\\nthe vision (of the product and the project), (4) recognize that others consume (and\\nmust understand) what you produce, (5) be open to the future, (6) plan ahead for\\nreuse, and (7) think! Although these general principles are important, they are char-\\nacterized at such a high level of abstraction that they are sometimes difficult to trans-\\nlate into day-to-day software engineering practice. In the subsections that follow, I\\ntake a more detailed look at the core principles that guide process and practice.\\n4.2.1 Principles That Guide Process\\nIn Part 1 of this book I discussed the importance of the software process and\\ndescribed the many different process models that have been proposed for software\\nengineering work. Regardless of whether a model is linear or iterative, prescriptive\\nor agile, it can be characterized using the generic process framework that is appli-\\ncable for all process models. The following set of core principles can be applied to\\nthe framework, and by extension, to every software process.\\nPrinciple 1. Be agile. Whether the process model you choose is prescrip-\\ntive or agile, the basic tenets of agile development should govern your\\napproach. Every aspect of the work you do should emphasize economy of\\naction—keep your technical approach as simple as possible, keep the work\\nproducts you produce as concise as possible, and make decisions locally\\nwhenever possible.\\nPrinciple 2. Focus on quality at every step. The exit condition for every\\nprocess activity, action, and task should focus on the quality of the work\\nproduct that has been produced.\\nPrinciple 3. Be ready to adapt. Process is not a religious experience, and\\ndogma has no place in it. When necessary, adapt your approach to con-\\nstraints imposed by the problem, the people, and the project itself.\\nPrinciple 4. Build an effective team. Software engineering process and\\npractice are important, but the bottom line is people. Build a self-organizing\\nteam that has mutual trust and respect.\\n98 PART TWO MODELING\\nuote:\\n“In theory there is\\nno difference\\nbetween theory and\\npractice.

These are management issues and they must be addressed.\\nPrinciple 6. Manage change. The approach may be either formal or infor-\\nmal, but mechanisms must be established to manage the way changes are\\nrequested, assessed, approved, and implemented.\\nPrinciple 7. Assess risk. Lots of things can go wrong as software is being\\ndeveloped. It’s essential that you establish contingency plans.\\nPrinciple 8. Create work products that provide value for others.\\nCreate only those work products that provide value for other process\\nactivities, actions, or tasks. Every work product that is produced as part of\\nsoftware engineering practice will be passed on to someone else. A list of\\nrequired functions and features will be passed along to the person (people)\\nwho will develop a design, the design will be passed along to those who\\ngenerate code, and so on. Be sure that the work product imparts the necessary\\ninformation without ambiguity or omission.\\nPart 4 of this book focuses on project and process management issues and\\nconsiders various aspects of each of these principles in some detail.\\n4.2.2 Principles That Guide Practice\\nSoftware engineering practice has a single overriding goal—to deliver on-time, high-\\nquality, operational software that contains functions and features that meet the\\nneeds of all stakeholders. To achieve this goal, you should adopt a set of core prin-\\nciples that guide your technical work. These principles have merit regardless of the\\nanalysis and design methods that you apply, the construction techniques (e.g., pro-\\ngramming language, automated tools) that you use, or the verification and valida-\\ntion approach that you choose. The following set of core principles are fundamental\\nto the practice of software engineering:\\nPrinciple 1. Divide and conquer. Stated in a more technical manner,\\nanalysis and design should always emphasize separation of concerns (SoC). A\\nlarge problem is easier to solve if it is subdivided into a collection of elements\\n(or concerns). Ideally, each concern delivers distinct functionality that can be\\ndeveloped, and in some cases validated, independently of other concerns.\\nPrinciple 2. Understand the use of abstraction. At its core, an abstrac-\\ntion is a simplification of some complex element of a system used to commu-\\nnicate meaning in a single phrase. When I use the abstraction spreadsheet, it\\nis assumed that you understand what a spreadsheet is, the general structure\\nof content that a spreadsheet presents, and the typical functions that can be\\napplied to it. In software engineering practice, you use many different levels\\nCHAPTER 4 PRINCIPLES THAT GUIDE PRACTICE 99\\nuote:\\n“The truth of the\\nmatter is that you\\nalways know the\\nright thing to do.\\nThe hard part is\\ndoing it.”\\nGeneral H.\\nNorman\\nSchwarzkopf\\nProblems are easier to\\nsolve when they are\\nsubdivided into\\nseparate concerns,\\neach distinct,\\nindividually solvable,\\nand verifiable.\\npre75977_ch04.qxd  11/27/08  3:27 PM  Page 99'),\n",

In analysis and design work, a software team normally begins with\\nmodels that represent high levels of abstraction (e.g., a spreadsheet) and\\nslowly refines those models into lower levels of abstraction (e.g., a column\\nor the SUM function).\\nJoel Spolsky [Spo02] suggests that “all non-trivial abstractions, to some\\ndegree, are leaky.” The intent of an abstraction is to eliminate the need to\\ncommunicate details. But sometimes, problematic effects precipitated by\\nthese details “leak” through. Without an understanding of the details, the\\ncause of a problem cannot be easily diagnosed.\\nPrinciple 3. Strive for consistency. Whether it’s creating a requirements\\nmodel, developing a software design, generating source code, or creating\\ntest cases, the principle of consistency suggests that a familiar context makes\\nsoftware easier to use. As an example, consider the design of a user interface\\nfor a WebApp. Consistent placement of menu options, the use of a consistent\\ncolor scheme, and the consistent use of recognizable icons all help to make\\nthe interface ergonomically sound.\\nPrinciple 4. Focus on the transfer of information. Software is about\\ninformation transfer—from a database to an end user, from a legacy system\\nto a WebApp, from an end user into a graphic user interface (GUI), from an\\noperating system to an application, from one software component to an-\\nother—the list is almost endless. In every case, information flows across an\\ninterface, and as a consequence, there are opportunities for error, or omis-\\nsion, or ambiguity. The implication of this principle is that you must pay spe-\\ncial attention to the analysis, design, construction, and testing of interfaces.\\nPrinciple 5. Build software that exhibits effective modularity.\\nSeparation of concerns (Principle 1) establishes a philosophy for software.\\nModularity provides a mechanism for realizing the philosophy. Any complex\\nsystem can be divided into modules (components), but good software engi-\\nneering practice demands more. Modularity must be effective. That is, each\\nmodule should focus exclusively on one well-constrained aspect of the\\nsystem—it should be cohesive in its function and/or constrained in the\\ncontent it represents. Additionally, modules should be interconnected in a\\nrelatively simple manner—each module should exhibit low coupling to other\\nmodules, to data sources, and to other environmental aspects.\\nPrinciple 6. Look for patterns. Brad Appleton [App00] suggests that: \\nThe goal of patterns within the software community is to create a body of literature\\nto help software developers resolve recurring problems encountered throughout\\nall of software development. Patterns help create a shared language for commu-\\nnicating insight and experience about these problems and their solutions. Formally\\ncodifying these solutions and their relationships lets us successfully capture the\\n100 PART TWO MODELING\\nUse patterns \\n(Chapter 12) to\\ncapture knowledge and\\nexperience for future\\ngenerations of\\nsoftware engineers.\\npre75977_ch04.qxd  11/27/08  3:27 PM  Page 100'),\n",

When possible, represent the problem and its solution\\nfrom a number of different perspectives. When a problem and its solution\\nare examined from a number of different perspectives, it is more likely that\\ngreater insight will be achieved and that errors and omissions will be uncov-\\nered. For example, a requirements model can be represented using a data-\\noriented viewpoint, a function-oriented viewpoint, or a behavioral viewpoint\\n(Chapters 6 and 7). Each provides a different view of the problem and its\\nrequirements.\\nPrinciple 8. Remember that someone will maintain the software. Over\\nthe long term, software will be corrected as defects are uncovered, adapted\\nas its environment changes, and enhanced as stakeholders request more\\ncapabilities. These maintenance activities can be facilitated if solid software\\nengineering practice is applied throughout the software process.\\nThese principles are not all you’ll need to build high-quality software, but they do\\nestablish a foundation for every software engineering method discussed in this book.\\n4.3 P RINCIPLES THAT GUIDE EACH FRAMEWORK ACTIVITY\\nIn the sections that follow I consider principles that have a strong bearing on the suc-\\ncess of each generic framework activity defined as part of the software process. In\\nmany cases, the principles that are discussed for each of the framework activities are\\na refinement of the principles presented in Section 4.2. They are simply core princi-\\nples stated at a lower level of abstraction.\\n4.3.1 Communication Principles\\nBefore customer requirements can be analyzed, modeled, or specified they must\\nbe gathered through the communication activity. A customer has a problem that may\\nbe amenable to a computer-based solution. You respond to the customer’s request\\nfor help. Communication has begun. But the road from communication to under-\\nstanding is often full of potholes.\\nEffective communication (among technical peers, with the customer and other\\nstakeholders, and with project managers) is among the most challenging activities\\nthat you will confront. In this context, I discuss communication principles as they\\napply to customer communication. However, many of the principles apply equally to\\nall forms of communication that occur within a software project.\\nPrinciple 1.Listen. Try to focus on the speaker’s words, rather than formu-\\nlating your response to those words. Ask for clarification if something is un-\\nclear, but avoid constant interruptions.Never become contentious in your words\\nor actions (e.g., rolling your eyes or shaking your head) as a person is talking.\\nCHAPTER 4 PRINCIPLES THAT GUIDE PRACTICE 101\\nuote:\\n“The ideal engineer\\nis a composite. . . .\\nHe is not a\\nscientist, he is not a\\nmathematician, he\\nis not a sociologist\\nor a writer; but he\\nmay use the\\nknowledge and\\ntechniques of any\\nor all of these\\ndisciplines in\\nsolving engineering\\nproblems.”\\nN.

Prepare before you communicate. Spend the time to under-\\nstand the problem before you meet with others. If necessary, do some re-\\nsearch to understand business domain jargon. If you have responsibility for\\nconducting a meeting, prepare an agenda in advance of the meeting.\\nPrinciple 3. Someone should facilitate the activity. Every communica-\\ntion meeting should have a leader (a facilitator) to keep the conversation\\nmoving in a productive direction, (2) to mediate any conflict that does occur,\\nand (3) to ensure than other principles are followed.\\nPrinciple 4. Face-to-face communication is best. But it usually works\\nbetter when some other representation of the relevant information is present.\\nFor example, a participant may create a drawing or a “strawman” document\\nthat serves as a focus for discussion.\\nPrinciple 5. Take notes and document decisions. Things have a way of\\nfalling into the cracks. Someone participating in the communication should\\nserve as a “recorder” and write down all important points and decisions.\\nPrinciple 6. Strive for collaboration. Collaboration and consensus occur\\nwhen the collective knowledge of members of the team is used to\\ndescribe product or system functions or features. Each small collaboration\\nserves to build trust among team members and creates a common goal for\\nthe team.\\nPrinciple 7. Stay focused; modularize your discussion. The more\\npeople involved in any communication, the more likely that discussion will\\nbounce from one topic to the next. The facilitator should keep the conversation\\nmodular, leaving one topic only after it has been resolved (however, see\\nPrinciple 9).\\nPrinciple 8. If something is unclear, draw a picture. Verbal communica-\\ntion goes only so far. A sketch or drawing can often provide clarity when\\nwords fail to do the job.\\nPrinciple 9. (a) Once you agree to something, move on. (b) If you can’t\\nagree to something, move on. (c) If a feature or function is unclear\\nand cannot be clarified at the moment, move on. Communication, like\\nany software engineering activity, takes time. Rather than iterating endlessly,\\nthe people who participate should recognize that many topics require discus-\\nsion (see Principle 2) and that “moving on” is sometimes the best way to\\nachieve communication agility.\\nPrinciple 10. Negotiation is not a contest or a game. It works best\\nwhen both parties win. There are many instances in which you and other\\nstakeholders must negotiate functions and features, priorities, and delivery\\ndates.

However, understanding these goals\\nand objectives is not the same as defining a plan for getting there. The planning\\nactivity encompasses a set of management and technical practices that enable the\\nsoftware team to define a road map as it travels toward its strategic goal and tacti-\\ncal objectives.\\nThe Difference Between Customers and End Users\\nSoftware engineers communicate with many\\ndifferent stakeholders, but customers and end\\nusers have the most significant impact on the technical\\nwork that follows. In some cases the customer and the end\\nuser are one and the same, but for many projects, the\\ncustomer and the end user are different people, working\\nfor different managers, in different business organizations.\\nA customer is the person or group who (1) originally\\nrequested the software to be built, (2) defines overall\\nbusiness objectives for the software, (3) provides basic\\nproduct requirements, and (4) coordinates funding for the\\nproject. In a product or system business, the customer\\nis often the marketing department. In an information\\ntechnology (IT) environment, the customer might be a\\nbusiness component or department.\\nAn end user is the person or group who (1) will\\nactually use the software that is built to achieve some\\nbusiness purpose and (2) will define operational \\ndetails of the software so the business purpose can be\\nachieved.\\nINFO\\npre75977_ch04.qxd  11/27/08  3:27 PM  Page 103'),\n",

There is no easy way to determine what unforeseen technical problems will\\nbe encountered, what important information will remain undiscovered until late in\\nthe project, what misunderstandings will occur, or what business issues will change.\\nAnd yet, a good software team must plan its approach.\\nThere are many different planning philosophies.\\n2 Some people are “minimalists,”\\narguing that change often obviates the need for a detailed plan. Others are “tradi-\\ntionalists,” arguing that the plan provides an effective road map and the more detail\\nit has, the less likely the team will become lost. Still others are “agilists,” arguing that\\na quick “planning game” may be necessary, but that the road map will emerge as\\n“real work” on the software begins.\\nWhat to do? On many projects, overplanning is time consuming and fruitless (too\\nmany things change), but underplanning is a recipe for chaos. Like most things in\\nlife, planning should be conducted in moderation, enough to provide useful guidance\\nfor the team—no more, no less. Regardless of the rigor with which planning is con-\\nducted, the following principles always apply:\\nPrinciple 1. Understand the scope of the project. It’s impossible to use\\na road map if you don’t know where you’re going. Scope provides the soft-\\nware team with a destination.\\nPrinciple 2. Involve stakeholders in the planning activity. Stakeholders\\ndefine priorities and establish project constraints. To accommodate these\\nrealities, software engineers must often negotiate order of delivery, time\\nlines, and other project-related issues.\\nPrinciple 3. Recognize that planning is iterative. A project plan is never\\nengraved in stone. As work begins, it is very likely that things will change. As\\na consequence, the plan must be adjusted to accommodate these changes. In\\naddition, iterative, incremental process models dictate replanning after the\\ndelivery of each software increment based on feedback received from users.\\nPrinciple 4. Estimate based on what you know. The intent of estimation\\nis to provide an indication of effort, cost, and task duration, based on the\\nteam’s current understanding of the work to be done. If information is vague\\nor unreliable, estimates will be equally unreliable.\\nPrinciple 5. Consider risk as you define the plan. If you have identified\\nrisks that have high impact and high probability, contingency planning is\\nnecessary. In addition, the project plan (including the schedule) should be\\nadjusted to accommodate the likelihood that one or more of these risks will\\noccur.\\n104 PART TWO MODELING\\nuote:\\n“In preparing for\\nbattle I have\\nalways found that\\nplans are useless,\\nbut planning is\\nindispensable.”\\nGeneral Dwight\\nD.

Granularity\\nrefers to the level of detail that is introduced as a project plan is developed.\\nA “high-granularity” plan provides significant work task detail that is planned\\nover relatively short time increments (so that tracking and control occur\\nfrequently). A “low-granularity” plan provides broader work tasks that are\\nplanned over longer time periods. In general, granularity moves from high to\\nlow as the project time line moves away from the current date.

If pair programming\\n(Chapter 3) is to be used during construction, it should be explicitly defined\\nwithin the plan.\\nPrinciple 9. Describe how you intend to accommodate change. Even\\nthe best planning can be obviated by uncontrolled change. You should iden-\\ntify how changes are to be accommodated as software engineering work\\nproceeds. For example, can the customer request a change at any time? If a\\nchange is requested, is the team obliged to implement it immediately? How is\\nthe impact and cost of the change assessed?\\nPrinciple 10. Track the plan frequently and make adjustments as re-\\nquired. Software projects fall behind schedule one day at a time. Therefore,\\nit makes sense to track progress on a daily basis, looking for problem areas\\nand situations in which scheduled work does not conform to actual work\\nconducted.

Models must\\naccomplish these objectives at different levels of abstraction—first depicting the soft-\\nware from the customer’s viewpoint and later representing the software at a more\\ntechnical level.\\nIn software engineering work, two classes of models can be created: require-\\nments models and design models.

Models that make this happen are worth creat-\\ning, but models that slow the process down or provide little new insight\\nshould be avoided.\\nPrinciple 2. Travel light—don’t create more models than you need.\\nEvery model that is created must be kept up-to-date as changes occur. More\\nimportantly, every new model takes time that might otherwise be spent on\\nconstruction (coding and testing). Therefore, create only those models that\\nmake it easier and faster to construct the software.\\nPrinciple 3. Strive to produce the simplest model that will describe the\\nproblem or the software. Don’t overbuild the software [Amb02b]. By\\nkeeping models simple, the resultant software will also be simple. The result\\nis software that is easier to integrate, easier to test, and easier to maintain (to\\nchange). In addition, simple models are easier for members of the software\\nteam to understand and critique, resulting in an ongoing form of feedback\\nthat optimizes the end result.\\nPrinciple 4.Build models in a way that makes them amenable to change.\\nAssume that your models will change, but in making this assumption don’t\\n106 PART TWO MODELING\\nRequirements models\\nrepresent customer\\nrequirements.

For example, since requirements will change, there is a tendency\\nto give requirements models short shrift. Why? Because you know that they’ll\\nchange anyway. The problem with this attitude is that without a reasonably\\ncomplete requirements model, you’ll create a design (design model) that will\\ninvariably miss important functions and features.\\nPrinciple 5. Be able to state an explicit purpose for each model that\\nis created. Every time you create a model, ask yourself why you’re doing\\nso. If you can’t provide solid justification for the existence of the model,\\ndon’t spend time on it.\\nPrinciple 6. Adapt the models you develop to the system at hand. It\\nmay be necessary to adapt model notation or rules to the application; for ex-\\nample, a video game application might require a different modeling technique\\nthan real-time, embedded software that controls an automobile engine.\\nPrinciple 7. Try to build useful models, but forget about building per-\\nfect models. When building requirements and design models, a software\\nengineer reaches a point of diminishing returns. That is, the effort required to\\nmake the model absolutely complete and internally consistent is not worth\\nthe benefits of these properties. Am I suggesting that modeling should be\\nsloppy or low quality? The answer is “no.” But modeling should be conducted\\nwith an eye to the next software engineering steps. Iterating endlessly to\\nmake a model “perfect” does not serve the need for agility.\\nPrinciple 8. Don’t become dogmatic about the syntax of the model. If\\nit communicates content successfully, representation is secondary.\\nAlthough everyone on a software team should try to use consistent notation\\nduring modeling, the most important characteristic of the model is to com-\\nmunicate information that enables the next software engineering task. If a\\nmodel does this successfully, incorrect syntax can be forgiven.\\nPrinciple 9. If your instincts tell you a model isn’t right even though it\\nseems okay on paper, you probably have reason to be concerned. If\\nyou are an experienced software engineer, trust your instincts. Software\\nwork teaches many lessons—some of them on a subconscious level. If some-\\nthing tells you that a design model is doomed to fail (even though you can’t\\nprove it explicitly), you have reason to spend additional time examining the\\nmodel or developing a different one.\\nPrinciple 10. Get feedback as soon as you can. Every model should be\\nreviewed by members of the software team. The intent of these reviews is to\\nprovide feedback that can be used to correct modeling mistakes, change mis-\\ninterpretations, and add features or functions that were inadvertently omitted.\\nRequirements modeling principles.

Each analysis method has a unique point of view. However, all analysis meth-\\nods are related by a set of operational principles:\\nPrinciple 1. The information domain of a problem must be represented\\nand understood. The information domain encompasses the data that flow\\ninto the system (from end users, other systems, or external devices), the data\\nthat flow out of the system (via the user interface, network interfaces, reports,\\ngraphics, and other means), and the data stores that collect and organize per-\\nsistent data objects (i.e., data that are maintained permanently).\\nPrinciple 2. The functions that the software performs must be defined.\\nSoftware functions provide direct benefit to end users and also provide inter-\\nnal support for those features that are user visible. Some functions transform\\ndata that flow into the system. In other cases, functions effect some level of\\ncontrol over internal software processing or external system elements. Func-\\ntions can be described at many different levels of abstraction, ranging from a\\ngeneral statement of purpose to a detailed description of the processing\\nelements that must be invoked.\\nPrinciple 3. The behavior of the software (as a consequence of external\\nevents) must be represented. The behavior of computer software is driven\\nby its interaction with the external environment. Input provided by end users,\\ncontrol data provided by an external system, or monitoring data collected\\nover a network all cause the software to behave in a specific way.\\nPrinciple 4.The models that depict information, function, and behavior\\nmust be partitioned in a manner that uncovers detail in a layered (or\\nhierarchical) fashion. Requirements modeling is the first step in software\\nengineering problem solving. It allows you to better understand the problem\\nand establishes a basis for the solution (design). Complex problems are difficult\\nto solve in their entirety. For this reason, you should use a divide-and-conquer\\nstrategy. A large, complex problem is divided into subproblems until each sub-\\nproblem is relatively easy to understand. This concept is called partitioningor\\nseparation of concerns,and it is a key strategy in requirements modeling.\\nPrinciple 5.The analysis task should move from essential information\\ntoward implementation detail. Requirements modeling begins by describ-\\ning the problem from the end-user’s perspective. The “essence” of the\\nproblem is described without any consideration of how a solution will be\\nimplemented. For example, a video game requires that the player “instruct”\\nits protagonist on what direction to proceed as she moves into a dangerous\\nmaze. That is the essence of the problem. Implementation detail (normally\\ndescribed as part of the design model) indicates how the essence will be\\nimplemented. For the video game, voice input might be used. Alternatively,\\n108 PART TWO MODELING\\nAnalysis modeling\\nfocuses on three\\nattributes of software:\\ninformation to be\\nprocessed, function to\\nbe delivered, and\\nbehavior to be\\nexhibited.\\nuote:\\n“The engineer’s\\nfirst problem in\\nany design\\nsituation is to\\ndiscover what the\\nproblem really is.”\\nAuthor unknown\\npre75977_ch04.qxd  11/27/08  3:27 PM  Page 108'),\n",

But how are these principles applied in practice? This question will be an-\\nswered in Chapters 5 through 7.\\nDesign Modeling Principles. The software design model is analogous to an\\narchitect’s plans for a house. It begins by representing the totality of the thing to be\\nbuilt (e.g., a three-dimensional rendering of the house) and slowly refines the thing\\nto provide guidance for constructing each detail (e.g., the plumbing layout). Similarly,\\nthe design model that is created for software provides a variety of different views of\\nthe system.\\nThere is no shortage of methods for deriving the various elements of a software\\ndesign. Some methods are data driven, allowing the data structure to dictate the pro-\\ngram architecture and the resultant processing components. Others are pattern\\ndriven, using information about the problem domain (the requirements model) to de-\\nvelop architectural styles and processing patterns. Still others are object oriented,\\nusing problem domain objects as the driver for the creation of data structures and\\nthe methods that manipulate them. Yet all embrace a set of design principles that can\\nbe applied regardless of the method that is used:\\nPrinciple 1. Design should be traceable to the requirements model.\\nThe requirements model describes the information domain of the problem,\\nuser-visible functions, system behavior, and a set of requirements classes\\nthat package business objects with the methods that service them. The de-\\nsign model translates this information into an architecture, a set of subsys-\\ntems that implement major functions, and a set of components that are the\\nrealization of requirements classes. The elements of the design model should\\nbe traceable to the requirements model.\\nPrinciple 2. Always consider the architecture of the system to be built.\\nSoftware architecture (Chapter 9) is the skeleton of the system to be built. It\\naffects interfaces, data structures, program control flow and behavior, the\\nmanner in which testing can be conducted, the maintainability of the result-\\nant system, and much more. For all of these reasons, design should start with\\narchitectural considerations. Only after the architecture has been established\\nshould component-level issues be considered.\\nPrinciple 3. Design of data is as important as design of processing\\nfunctions. Data design is an essential element of architectural design. The\\nmanner in which data objects are realized within the design cannot be left to\\nchance. A well-structured data design helps to simplify program flow, makes\\nthe design and implementation of software components easier, and makes\\noverall processing more efficient.\\nCHAPTER 4 PRINCIPLES THAT GUIDE PRACTICE 109\\nuote:\\n“See first that the\\ndesign is wise\\nand just: that\\nascertained, pursue\\nit resolutely; do not\\nfor one repulse\\nforego the purpose\\nthat you resolved\\nto effect.”\\nWilliam\\nShakespeare\\nWebRef\\nInsightful comments\\non the design process,\\nalong with a discussion\\nof design aesthetics,\\ncan be found at\\ncs.wwc.edu/\\n~aabyan/Design/.\\npre75977_ch04.qxd  11/27/08  3:27 PM  Page 109'),\n",

Interfaces (both internal and external) must be designed\\nwith care. The manner in which data flows between the components of a\\nsystem has much to do with processing efficiency, error propagation, and\\ndesign simplicity. A well-designed interface makes integration easier and\\nassists the tester in validating component functions.\\nPrinciple 5. User interface design should be tuned to the needs of the\\nend user. However, in every case, it should stress ease of use.The\\nuser interface is the visible manifestation of the software. No matter how\\nsophisticated its internal functions, no matter how comprehensive its data\\nstructures, no matter how well designed its architecture, a poor interface\\ndesign often leads to the perception that the software is “bad.”\\nPrinciple 6. Component-level design should be functionally independ-\\nent. Functional independence is a measure of the “single-mindedness” of a\\nsoftware component. The functionality that is delivered by a component\\nshould be cohesive—that is, it should focus on one and only one function or\\nsubfunction.\\n5\\nPrinciple 7. Components should be loosely coupled to one another\\nand to the external environment. Coupling is achieved in many ways—\\nvia a component interface, by messaging, through global data. As the level of\\ncoupling increases, the likelihood of error propagation also increases and the\\noverall maintainability of the software decreases. Therefore, component cou-\\npling should be kept as low as is reasonable.\\nPrinciple 8. Design representations (models) should be easily under-\\nstandable. The purpose of design is to communicate information to practi-\\ntioners who will generate code, to those who will test the software, and to\\nothers who may maintain the software in the future. If the design is difficult\\nto understand, it will not serve as an effective communication medium.\\nPrinciple 9. The design should be developed iteratively. With each\\niteration, the designer should strive for greater simplicity. Like almost\\nall creative activities, design occurs iteratively. The first iterations work to\\nrefine the design and correct errors, but later iterations should strive to make\\nthe design as simple as is possible.\\nWhen these design principles are properly applied, you create a design that exhibits\\nboth external and internal quality factors [Mye78]. External quality factors are those\\nproperties of the software that can be readily observed by users (e.g., speed, reliability,\\ncorrectness, usability). Internal quality factorsare of importance to software engineers.\\nThey lead to a high-quality design from the technical perspective. To achieve internal\\nquality factors, the designer must understand basic design concepts (Chapter 8).\\n110 PART TWO MODELING\\nuote:\\n“The differences\\nare not minor—\\nthey are rather like\\nthe differences\\nbetween Salieri\\nand Mozart.

The principles that guide the coding task are closely aligned\\nwith programming style, programming languages, and programming methods.\\nHowever, there are a number of fundamental principles that can be stated:\\nPreparation principles: Before you write one line of code, be sure you\\n• Understand of the problem you’re trying to solve.\\n• Understand basic design principles and concepts.\\n• Pick a programming language that meets the needs of the software to be\\nbuilt and the environment in which it will operate.\\n• Select a programming environment that provides tools that will make your\\nwork easier.\\n• Create a set of unit tests that will be applied once the component you code is\\ncompleted.\\nProgramming principles: As you begin writing code, be sure you\\n• Constrain your algorithms by following structured programming [Boh00]\\npractice.\\n• Consider the use of pair programming.\\n• Select data structures that will meet the needs of the design.\\n• Understand the software architecture and create interfaces that are\\nconsistent with it.\\n• Keep conditional logic as simple as possible.\\n• Create nested loops in a way that makes them easily testable.\\n• Select meaningful variable names and follow other local coding standards.\\nCHAPTER 4 PRINCIPLES THAT GUIDE PRACTICE 111\\nuote:\\n“For much of my\\nlife, I have been a\\nsoftware voyeur,\\npeeking furtively\\nat other people’s\\ndirty code.\\nOccasionally, I find\\na real jewel, a well-\\nstructured program\\nwritten in a\\nconsistent style,\\nfree of kludges,\\ndeveloped so that\\neach component is\\nsimple and\\norganized, and\\ndesigned so that\\nthe product is easy\\nto change.”\\nDavid Parnas\\nAvoid developing an\\nelegant program that\\nsolves the wrong\\nproblem.

If you have further interest, examine one or more of the references\\nnoted.\\nTesting Principles. In a classic book on software testing, Glen Myers [Mye79]\\nstates a number of rules that can serve well as testing objectives:\\n• Testing is a process of executing a program with the intent of finding\\nan error.\\n• A good test case is one that has a high probability of finding an as-yet-\\nundiscovered error.\\n• A successful test is one that uncovers an as-yet-undiscovered error.\\nThese objectives imply a dramatic change in viewpoint for some software develop-\\ners. They move counter to the commonly held view that a successful test is one in\\nwhich no errors are found. Your objective is to design tests that systematically un-\\ncover different classes of errors and to do so with a minimum amount of time and\\neffort.\\nIf testing is conducted successfully (according to the objectives stated previously),\\nit will uncover errors in the software. As a secondary benefit, testing demonstrates\\nthat software functions appear to be working according to specification, and that\\nbehavioral and performance requirements appear to have been met. In addition, the\\ndata collected as testing is conducted provide a good indication of software reliabil-\\nity and some indication of software quality as a whole. But testing cannot show the\\nabsence of errors and defects; it can show only that software errors and defects are\\npresent. It is important to keep this (rather gloomy) statement in mind as testing is\\nbeing conducted.\\n112 PART TWO MODELING\\nWebRef\\nA wide variety of links\\nto coding standards can\\nbe found at www\\n.literateprogramm\\ning.com/fpstyle\\n.html.\\nWhat are the\\nobjectives of\\nsoftware testing?\\n?\\nIn a broader software\\ndesign context, recall\\nthat you begin “in the\\nlarge” by focusing on\\nsoftware architecture\\nand end “in the small“\\nfocusing on compo-\\nnents.

All tests should be traceable to customer requirements.7\\nThe objective of software testing is to uncover errors. It follows that the most\\nsevere defects (from the customer’s point of view) are those that cause the\\nprogram to fail to meet its requirements.\\nPrinciple 2. Tests should be planned long before testing begins. Test\\nplanning (Chapter 17) can begin as soon as the requirements model is com-\\nplete. Detailed definition of test cases can begin as soon as the design model\\nhas been solidified. Therefore, all tests can be planned and designed before\\nany code has been generated.\\nPrinciple 3. The Pareto principle applies to software testing. In this\\ncontext the Pareto principle implies that 80 percent of all errors uncovered\\nduring testing will likely be traceable to 20 percent of all program compo-\\nnents. The problem, of course, is to isolate these suspect components and to\\nthoroughly test them.\\nPrinciple 4. Testing should begin “in the small” and progress toward\\ntesting “in the large.” The first tests planned and executed generally focus\\non individual components. As testing progresses, focus shifts in an attempt\\nto find errors in integrated clusters of components and ultimately in the\\nentire system.\\nPrinciple 5. Exhaustive testing is not possible. The number of path per-\\nmutations for even a moderately sized program is exceptionally large. For\\nthis reason, it is impossible to execute every combination of paths during\\ntesting. It is possible, however, to adequately cover program logic and to en-\\nsure that all conditions in the component-level design have been exercised.\\n4.3.5 Deployment Principles\\nAs I noted earlier in Part 1 of this book, the deployment activity encompasses three\\nactions: delivery, support, and feedback. Because modern software process models\\nare evolutionary or incremental in nature, deployment happens not once, but a num-\\nber of times as software moves toward completion. Each delivery cycle provides the\\ncustomer and end users with an operational software increment that provides usable\\nfunctions and features. Each support cycle provides documentation and human\\nassistance for all functions and features introduced during all deployment cycles to\\nCHAPTER 4 PRINCIPLES THAT GUIDE PRACTICE 113\\n6 Only a small subset of Davis’s testing principles are noted here.

Each feedback cycle provides the software team with important guidance that\\nresults in modifications to the functions, features, and approach taken for the next\\nincrement.\\nThe delivery of a software increment represents an important milestone for any\\nsoftware project. A number of key principles should be followed as the team pre-\\npares to deliver an increment:\\nPrinciple 1. Customer expectations for the software must be managed.\\nToo often, the customer expects more than the team has promised to deliver,\\nand disappointment occurs immediately. This results in feedback that is not\\nproductive and ruins team morale. In her book on managing expectations,\\nNaomi Karten [Kar94] states: “The starting point for managing expectations\\nis to become more conscientious about what you communicate and how.”\\nShe suggests that a software engineer must be careful about sending the cus-\\ntomer conflicting messages (e.g., promising more than you can reasonably\\ndeliver in the time frame provided or delivering more than you promise for\\none software increment and then less than promised for the next).\\nPrinciple 2. A complete delivery package should be assembled and\\ntested. A CD-ROM or other media (including Web-based downloads)\\ncontaining all executable software, support data files, support documents,\\nand other relevant information should be assembled and thoroughly \\nbeta-tested with actual users. All installation scripts and other operational\\nfeatures should be thoroughly exercised in as many different computing\\nconfigurations (i.e., hardware, operating systems, peripheral devices, net-\\nworking arrangements) as possible.\\nPrinciple 3. A support regime must be established before the software\\nis delivered. An end user expects responsiveness and accurate information\\nwhen a question or problem arises. If support is ad hoc, or worse, nonexist-\\nent, the customer will become dissatisfied immediately. Support should be\\nplanned, support materials should be prepared, and appropriate record-\\nkeeping mechanisms should be established so that the software team can\\nconduct a categorical assessment of the kinds of support requested.\\nPrinciple 4. Appropriate instructional materials must be provided to\\nend users. The software team delivers more than the software itself.\\nAppropriate training aids (if required) should be developed; troubleshooting\\nguidelines should be provided, and when necessary, a “what’s different about\\nthis software increment” description should be published.\\n8\\n114 PART TWO MODELING\\nBe sure that your cus-\\ntomer knows what to\\nexpect before a soft-\\nware increment is\\ndelivered.

The soft-\\nware reminds them every day.”\\nThe delivered software provides benefit for the end user, but it also provides use-\\nful feedback for the software team. As the increment is put into use, end users should\\nbe encouraged to comment on features and functions, ease of use, reliability, and\\nany other characteristics that are appropriate.\\n4.4 S UMMARY\\nSoftware engineering practice encompasses principles, concepts, methods, and\\ntools that software engineers apply throughout the software process. Every software\\nengineering project is different. Yet, a set of generic principles apply to the process\\nas a whole and to the practice of each framework activity regardless of the project\\nor the product.\\nA set of core principles help in the application of a meaningful software process\\nand the execution of effective software engineering methods. At the process level,\\ncore principles establish a philosophical foundation that guides a software team as\\nit navigates through the software process. At the level of practice, core principles\\nestablish a collection of values and rules that serve as a guide as you analyze a prob-\\nlem, design a solution, implement and test the solution, and ultimately deploy the\\nsoftware in the user community.\\nCommunication principles focus on the need to reduce noise and improve band-\\nwidth as the conversation between developer and customer progresses. Both parties\\nmust collaborate for the best communication to occur.\\nPlanning principles provide guidelines for constructing the best map for the\\njourney to a completed system or product. The plan may be designed solely for a\\nsingle software increment, or it may be defined for the entire project. Regardless,\\nit must address what will be done, who will do it, and when the work will be\\ncompleted.\\nModeling encompasses both analysis and design, describing representations of\\nthe software that progressively become more detailed. The intent of the models is to\\nsolidify understanding of the work to be done and to provide technical guidance to\\nthose who will implement the software. Modeling principles serve as a founda-\\ntion for the methods and notation that are used to create representations of the\\nsoftware.\\nConstruction incorporates a coding and testing cycle in which source code for a\\ncomponent is generated and tested.

That’s why it’s\\nimportant to understand what the customer\\nwants before you begin to design and build a\\ncomputer-based system.\\nWhat are the steps? Requirements engineering\\nbegins with inception—a task that defines the\\nscope and nature of the problem to be solved. It\\nmoves onwards to elicitation—a task that helps\\nstakeholders define what is required, and then\\nQUICK\\nLOOK\\nelaboration—where basic requirements are\\nrefined and modified. As stakeholders define the\\nproblem, negotiation occurs—what are the\\npriorities, what is essential, when is it required?\\nFinally, the problem is specified in some manner\\nand then reviewed or validated to ensure that\\nyour understanding of the problem and the\\nstakeholders’ understanding of the problem\\ncoincide.\\nWhat is the work product?

In fact, building software is so compelling that many software developers want\\nto jump right in before they have a clear understanding of what is needed. They argue\\nthat things will become clear as they build, that project stakeholders will be able to\\nunderstand need only after examining early iterations of the software, that things\\nchange so rapidly that any attempt to understand requirements in detail is a waste\\nof time, that the bottom line is producing a working program and all else is second-\\nary.

From a software process perspective,\\nrequirements engineering is a major software engineering action that begins during\\nthe communication activity and continues into the modeling activity. It must be\\nadapted to the needs of the process, the project, the product, and the people doing\\nthe work.\\nRequirements engineering builds a bridge to design and construction. But where\\ndoes the bridge originate? One could argue that it begins at the feet of the project\\nstakeholders (e.g., managers, customers, end users), where business need is\\ndefined, user scenarios are described, functions and features are delineated, and\\nproject constraints are identified.

In some cases,\\na casual conversation is all that is needed to precipitate a major software engineer-\\ning effort. But in general, most projects begin when a business need is identified\\nor a potential new market or service is discovered. Stakeholders from the business\\ncommunity (e.g., business managers, marketing people, product managers) define\\na business case for the idea, try to identify the breadth and depth of the market, do a\\nrough feasibility analysis, and identify a working description of the project’s scope.\\nAll of this information is subject to change, but it is sufficient to precipitate discus-\\nsions with the software engineering organization.\\n2\\nAt project inception,3 you establish a basic understanding of the problem, the peo-\\nple who want a solution, the nature of the solution that is desired, and the effective-\\nness of preliminary communication and collaboration between the other stakeholders\\nand the software team.\\nElicitation. It certainly seems simple enough—ask the customer, the users, and\\nothers what the objectives for the system or product are, what is to be accomplished,\\nhow the system or product fits into the needs of the business, and finally, how the sys-\\ntem or product is to be used on a day-to-day basis.

The requirements change over time.\\nTo help overcome these problems, you must approach requirements gathering in an\\norganized manner.\\nElaboration. The information obtained from the customer during inception and\\nelicitation is expanded and refined during elaboration. This task focuses on devel-\\noping a refined requirements model (Chapters 6 and 7) that identifies various aspects\\nof software function, behavior, and information.\\nElaboration is driven by the creation and refinement of user scenarios that de-\\nscribe how the end user (and other actors) will interact with the system. Each user\\nscenario is parsed to extract analysis classes—business domain entities that are\\nvisible to the end user. The attributes of each analysis class are defined, and the serv-\\nices\\n4 that are required by each class are identified. The relationships and collabora-\\ntion between classes are identified, and a variety of supplementary diagrams are\\nproduced.\\nNegotiation. It isn’t unusual for customers and users to ask for more than can be\\nachieved, given limited business resources. It’s also relatively common for different\\ncustomers or users to propose conflicting requirements, arguing that their version is\\n“essential for our special needs.”\\nYou have to reconcile these conflicts through a process of negotiation. Customers,\\nusers, and other stakeholders are asked to rank requirements and then discuss con-\\nflicts in priority.

Requirements for computer-based systems\\nchange, and the desire to change requirements persists throughout the life of the\\nsystem. Requirements management is a set of activities that help the project team\\nidentify, control, and track requirements and changes to requirements at any time as\\nthe project proceeds.\\n6 Many of these activities are identical to the software configu-\\nration management (SCM) techniques discussed in Chapter 22.\\n6 Formal requirements management is initiated only for large projects that have hundreds of identi-\\nfiable requirements. For small projects, this requirements engineering action is considerably less\\nformal.\\nRequirements Validation\\nChecklist\\nIt is often useful to examine each requirement\\nagainst a set of checklist questions. Here is a small subset\\nof those that might be asked:\\n• Are requirements stated clearly? Can they be\\nmisinterpreted?\\n• Is the source (e.g., a person, a regulation, a document)\\nof the requirement identified? Has the final statement of\\nthe requirement been examined by or against the\\noriginal source?\\n• Is the requirement bounded in quantitative terms?\\n• What other requirements relate to this requirement? Are\\nthey clearly noted via a cross-reference matrix or other\\nmechanism?\\n• Does the requirement violate any system domain\\nconstraints?\\n• Is the requirement testable? If so, can we specify tests\\n(sometimes called validation criteria) to exercise the\\nrequirement?\\n• Is the requirement traceable to any system model that\\nhas been created?\\n• Is the requirement traceable to overall system/product\\nobjectives?\\n• Is the specification structured in a way that leads to\\neasy understanding, easy reference, and easy\\ntranslation into more technical work products?\\n• Has an index for the specification been created?\\n• Have requirements associated with performance,\\nbehavior, and operational characteristics been clearly\\nstated? What requirements appear to be implicit?\\nA key concern during\\nrequirements valida-\\ntion is consistency.

But reality is often quite different.\\nCustomer(s) or end users may be located in a different city or country, may have\\nonly a vague idea of what is required, may have conflicting opinions about the sys-\\ntem to be built, may have limited technical knowledge, and may have limited time to\\ninteract with the requirements engineer. None of these things are desirable, but all\\nare fairly common, and you are often forced to work within the constraints imposed\\nby this situation.\\nIn the sections that follow, I discuss the steps required to establish the ground-\\nwork for an understanding of software requirements—to get the project started in a\\nway that will keep it moving forward toward a successful solution.\\n5.2.1 Identifying Stakeholders\\nSommerville and Sawyer [Som97] define a stakeholder as “anyone who benefits\\nin a direct or indirect way from the system which is being developed.” I have already\\nCHAPTER 5 UNDERSTANDING REQUIREMENTS 125\\nRequirements Engineering\\nObjective: Requirements engineering tools\\nassist in requirements gathering, requirements\\nmodeling, requirements management, and requirements\\nvalidation.\\nMechanics: Tool mechanics vary.

These\\nmodels form the basis for all other activities in the\\nsoftware process.\\nRepresentative Tools:\\n7\\nA reasonably comprehensive (and up-to-date) listing of\\nrequirements engineering tools can be found at the Volvere\\nRequirements resources site at www.volere.co.uk/\\ntools.htm.

The initial list will grow as stakeholders are\\ncontacted because every stakeholder will be asked: “Whom else do you think I\\nshould talk to?”\\n5.2.2 Recognizing Multiple Viewpoints\\nBecause many different stakeholders exist, the requirements of the system will be\\nexplored from many different points of view. For example, the marketing group is in-\\nterested in functions and features that will excite the potential market, making the\\nnew system easy to sell. Business managers are interested in a feature set that can\\nbe built within budget and that will be ready to meet defined market windows. End\\nusers may want features that are familiar to them and that are easy to learn and use.\\nSoftware engineers may be concerned with functions that are invisible to nontech-\\nnical stakeholders but that enable an infrastructure that supports more marketable\\nfunctions and features. Support engineers may focus on the maintainability of the\\nsoftware.\\nEach of these constituencies (and others) will contribute information to the re-\\nquirements engineering process. As information from multiple viewpoints is col-\\nlected, emerging requirements may be inconsistent or may conflict with one\\nanother. You should categorize all stakeholder information (including inconsistent\\nand conflicting requirements) in a way that will allow decision makers to choose an\\ninternally consistent set of requirements for the system.\\n5.2.3 Working toward Collaboration\\nIf five stakeholders are involved in a software project, you may have five (or more)\\ndifferent opinions about the proper set of requirements. Throughout earlier chapters,\\nI have noted that customers (and other stakeholders) must collaborate among them-\\nselves (avoiding petty turf battles) and with software engineering practitioners if a\\nsuccessful system is to result. But how is this collaboration accomplished?\\nThe job of a requirements engineer is to identify areas of commonality (i.e., re-\\nquirements on which all stakeholders agree) and areas of conflict or inconsistency\\n(i.e., requirements that are desired by one stakeholder but conflict with the\\nneeds of another stakeholder). It is, of course, the latter category that presents a\\nchallenge.\\n126 PART TWO MODELING\\nuote:\\n“Put three\\nstakeholders in a\\nroom and ask them\\nwhat kind of\\nsystem they want.\\nYou’re likely to get\\nfour or more\\ndifferent opinions.”\\nAuthor unknown\\npre75977_ch05.qxd  11/27/08  3:30 PM  Page 126'),\n",

The\\nfirst set of context-free questions focuses on the customer and other stakeholders,\\nthe overall project goals and benefits. For example, you might ask:\\n• Who is behind the request for this work?\\n• Who will use the solution?\\n• What will be the economic benefit of a successful solution?\\n• Is there another source for the solution that you need?\\nThese questions help to identify all stakeholders who will have interest in the\\nsoftware to be built. In addition, the questions identify the measurable benefit of\\na successful implementation and possible alternatives to custom software devel-\\nopment.\\nThe next set of questions enables you to gain a better understanding of the prob-\\nlem and allows the customer to voice his or her perceptions about a solution:\\n• How would you characterize “good” output that would be generated by a\\nsuccessful solution?\\n• What problem(s) will this solution address?\\n• Can you show me (or describe) the business environment in which the\\nsolution will be used?\\n• Will special performance issues or constraints affect the way the solution is\\napproached?\\nCHAPTER 5 UNDERSTANDING REQUIREMENTS 127\\nINFO\\nuote:\\n“It is better to\\nknow some of the\\nquestions than all\\nof the answers.”\\nJames Thurber\\nWhat\\nquestions\\nwill help you gain\\na preliminary\\nunderstanding of\\nthe problem?\\n?\\nUsing “Priority Points”\\nOne way of resolving conflicting\\nrequirements and at the same time better\\nunderstanding the relative importance of all requirements\\nis to use a “voting” scheme based on priority points.\\nAll stakeholders are provided with some number of\\npriority points that can be “spent” on any number of\\nrequirements.

Out of these initial meetings,\\nthe developer and customers write a one- or two-page “product request.” \\nA meeting place, time, and date are selected; a facilitator is chosen; and attendees\\nfrom the software team and other stakeholder organizations are invited to partici-\\npate. The product request is distributed to all attendees before the meeting date.\\nAs an example,\\n10 consider an excerpt from a product request written by a mar-\\nketing person involved in the SafeHomeproject. This person writes the following nar-\\nrative about the home security function that is to be part of SafeHome:\\nOur research indicates that the market for home management systems is growing at a\\nrate of 40 percent per year. The first SafeHomefunction we bring to market should be the\\nhome security function. Most people are familiar with “alarm systems” so this would be\\nan easy sell.\\nThe home security function would protect against and/or recognize a variety of un-\\ndesirable “situations” such as illegal entry, fire, flooding, carbon monoxide levels, and\\nothers. It’ll use our wireless sensors to detect each situation. It can be programmed by the\\nhomeowner, and will automatically telephone a monitoring agency when a situation is\\ndetected.\\nIn reality, others would contribute to this narrative during the requirements gath-\\nering meeting and considerably more information would be available. But even with\\nadditional information, ambiguity would be present, omissions would likely exist,\\nand errors might occur. For now, the preceding “functional description” will suffice.\\nWhile reviewing the product request in the days before the meeting, each at-\\ntendee is asked to make a list of objects that are part of the environment that sur-\\nrounds the system, other objects that are to be produced by the system, and objects\\nthat are used by the system to perform its functions. In addition, each attendee is\\nasked to make another list of services (processes or functions) that manipulate or in-\\nteract with the objects. Finally, lists of constraints (e.g., cost, size, business rules) and\\nperformance criteria (e.g., speed, accuracy) are also developed. The attendees are in-\\nformed that the lists are not expected to be exhaustive but are expected to reflect\\neach person’s perception of the system.\\nCHAPTER 5 UNDERSTANDING REQUIREMENTS 129\\nuote:\\n“We spend a lot of\\ntime—the\\nmajority of project\\neffort—not\\nimplementing or\\ntesting, but trying\\nto decide what to\\nbuild.”\\nBrian Lawrence\\nWebRef\\nJoint Application\\nDevelopment (JAD) is\\na popular technique \\nfor requirements\\ngathering.

Software provides interactive prompts, echo, and similar functions.\\nThe mini-specs are presented to all stakeholders for discussion. Additions, deletions,\\nand further elaboration are made. In some cases, the development of mini-specs will\\nuncover new objects, services, constraints, or performance requirements that will be\\nadded to the original lists. During all discussions, the team may raise an issue that\\ncannot be resolved during the meeting. An issues list is maintained so that these\\nideas will be acted on later.\\n130 PART TWO MODELING\\nAvoid the impulse to\\nshoot down a cus-\\ntomer’s idea as “too\\ncostly” or “impracti-\\ncal.” The idea here is\\nto negotiate a list that\\nis acceptable to all. To\\ndo this, you must keep\\nan open mind.\\n11 Rather than creating a mini-specification, many software teams elect to develop user scenarios\\ncalled use cases.

A variety of\\ndiagrams, matrices, and evaluation methods are then used to extract expected re-\\nquirements and to attempt to derive exciting requirements [Aka04].\\n5.3.3 Usage Scenarios\\nAs requirements are gathered, an overall vision of system functions and features be-\\ngins to materialize. However, it is difficult to move into more technical software en-\\ngineering activities until you understand how these functions and features will be\\nused by different classes of end users. To accomplish this, developers and users can\\ncreate a set of scenarios that identify a thread of usage for the system to be con-\\nstructed. The scenarios, often called use cases [ Jac92], provide a description of how\\nthe system will be used. Use cases are discussed in greater detail in Section 5.4.\\n132 PART TWO MODELING\\nWebRef\\nUseful information on\\nQFD can be obtained at\\nwww.qfdi.org.\\nThe scene: A meeting room,\\ncontinuing the first requirements gathering meeting.\\nThe players: Jamie Lazar, software team member;\\nVinod Raman, software team member; Ed Robbins,\\nsoftware team member; Doug Miller, software\\nengineering manager; three members of marketing; a\\nproduct engineering representative; and a facilitator.\\nThe conversation:\\nFacilitator: We’ve been talking about security for\\naccess to SafeHome functionality that will be accessible\\nvia the Internet.

Every actor has one or\\nmore goals when using the system.\\nIt is important to note that an actor and an end user are not necessarily the same\\nthing. A typical user may play a number of different roles when using a system,\\nwhereas an actor represents a class of external entities (often, but not always, peo-\\nple) that play just one role in the context of the use case. As an example, consider a\\nmachine operator (a user) who interacts with the control computer for a manufac-\\nturing cell that contains a number of robots and numerically controlled machines.\\nAfter careful review of requirements, the software for the control computer requires\\nfour different modes (roles) for interaction: programming mode, test mode, moni-\\ntoring mode, and troubleshooting mode. Therefore, four actors can be defined: pro-\\ngrammer, tester, monitor, and troubleshooter. In some cases, the machine operator\\ncan play all of these roles. In others, different people may play the role of each actor.\\nBecause requirements elicitation is an evolutionary activity, not all actors are\\nidentified during the first iteration. It is possible to identify primary actors [ Jac92]\\nduring the first iteration and secondary actors as more is learned about the system.\\nPrimary actors interact to achieve required system function and derive the intended\\nbenefit from the system. They work directly and frequently with the software.\\nSecondary actors support the system so that primary actors can do their work.\\nOnce actors have been identified, use cases can be developed.

However, other\\nelements of the model may be more volatile, indicating that stakeholders do not yet\\nfully understand requirements for the system. The analysis model and the methods\\nthat are used to build it are presented in detail in Chapters 6 and 7. I present a brief\\noverview in the sections that follow.\\n5.5.1 Elements of the Requirements Model\\nThere are many different ways to look at the requirements for a computer-based\\nsystem. Some software people argue that it’s best to select one mode of represen-\\ntation (e.g., the use case) and apply it to the exclusion of all other modes. Other\\npractitioners believe that it’s worthwhile to use a number of different modes of rep-\\nresentation to depict the requirements model. Different modes of representation\\nforce you to consider requirements from different viewpoints—an approach that has\\na higher probability of uncovering omissions, inconsistencies, and ambiguity.\\nThe specific elements of the requirements model are dictated by the analysis\\nmodeling method (Chapters 6 and 7) that is to be used. However, a set of generic\\nelements is common to most requirements models.\\nScenario-based elements. The system is described from the user’s point of view\\nusing a scenario-based approach. For example, basic use cases (Section 5.4) and\\ntheir corresponding use-case diagrams (Figure 5.2) evolve into more elaborate\\ntemplate-based use cases. Scenario-based elements of the requirements model\\nare often the first part of the model that is developed. As such, they serve as input for\\nthe creation of other modeling elements. Figure 5.3 depicts a UML activity diagram\\n17\\nfor eliciting requirements and representing them using use cases. Three levels of\\nelaboration are shown, culminating in a scenario-based representation.\\nClass-based elements. Each usage scenario implies a set of objects that are\\nmanipulated as an actor interacts with the system. These objects are categorized into\\nclasses—a collection of things that have similar attributes and common behaviors. For\\nexample, a UML class diagram can be used to depict aSensor class for theSafeHome\\nsecurity function (Figure 5.4). Note that the diagram lists the attributes of sensors (e.g.,\\nname, type) and the operations (e.g., identify, enable) that can be applied to modify\\nthese attributes. In addition to class diagrams, other analysis modeling elements de-\\npict the manner in which classes collaborate with one another and the relationships\\nand interactions between classes. These are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.\\nBehavioral elements. The behavior of a computer-based system can have a pro-\\nfound effect on the design that is chosen and the implementation approach that is\\napplied. Therefore, the requirements model must provide modeling elements that\\ndepict behavior.\\nCHAPTER 5 UNDERSTANDING REQUIREMENTS 139\\n17 A brief UML tutorial is presented in Appendix 1 for those who are unfamiliar with the notation.\\nIt is always a good\\nidea to get stakehold-\\ners involved. One of\\nthe best ways to do\\nthis is to have each\\nstakeholder write use\\ncases that describe\\nhow the software will\\nbe used.\\nOne way to isolate\\nclasses is to look for\\ndescriptive nouns in a\\nuse-case script.

Second, analysis\\npatterns facilitate the transformation of the analysis model into a design model by sug-\\ngesting design patterns and reliable solutions for common problems.\\nAnalysis patterns are integrated into the analysis model by reference to the pattern\\nname. They are also stored in a repository so that requirements engineers can use\\nsearch facilities to find and apply them. Information about an analysis pattern (and\\nother types of patterns) is presented in a standard template [Gey01]\\n19 that is dis-\\ncussed in more detail in Chapter 12. Examples of analysis patterns and further dis-\\ncussion of this topic are presented in Chapter 7.\\n5.6 N EGOTIATING REQUIREMENTS\\nIn an ideal requirements engineering context, the inception, elicitation, and elabo-\\nration tasks determine customer requirements in sufficient detail to proceed to sub-\\nsequent software engineering activities. Unfortunately, this rarely happens. In reality,\\nyou may have to enter into a negotiation with one or more stakeholders. In most\\ncases, stakeholders are asked to balance functionality, performance, and other prod-\\nuct or system characteristics against cost and time-to-market. The intent of this\\nnegotiation is to develop a project plan that meets stakeholder needs while at the\\n142 PART TWO MODELING\\n18 In some cases, problems reoccur regardless of the application domain.

That is, is a source (generally, a\\nspecific individual) noted for each requirement?\\n• Do any requirements conflict with other requirements?\\n• Is each requirement achievable in the technical environment that will house\\nthe system or product?\\n• Is each requirement testable, once implemented?\\n• Does the requirements model properly reflect the information, function, and\\nbehavior of the system to be built?\\nLisa (smiling): Yeah, they actually told me they got into\\nit and it wasn’t a “propeller head activity.”\\nDoug (laughing): I’ll be sure to take off my techie\\nbeanie the next time I visit . . .

This information is refined and ex-\\npanded during elicitation—a requirements gathering activity that makes use of facil-\\nitated meetings, QFD, and the development of usage scenarios.\\nElaboration further expands requirements in a model—a collection of scenario-\\nbased, class-based, behavioral, and flow-oriented elements. The model may refer-\\nence analysis patterns, solutions for analysis problems that have been seen to\\nreoccur across different applications.\\nAs requirements are identified and the requirements model is being created, the\\nsoftware team and other project stakeholders negotiate the priority, availability, and\\nrelative cost of each requirement.

A software engineer (sometimes\\ncalled an “analyst”) builds the model using\\nrequirements elicited from the customer.\\nWhy is it important?To validate software require-\\nments, you need to examine them from a number\\nof different points of view. In this chapter you’ll\\nconsider requirements modeling from three dif-\\nferent perspectives: scenario-based models, data\\n(information) models, and class-based models.\\nEach represents requirements in a different\\n“dimension,” thereby increasing the probability\\nthat errors will be found, that inconsistency will\\nsurface, and that omissions will be uncovered.\\nQUICK\\nLOOK\\nWhat are the steps?

Requirements analysis allows you (regardless\\nof whether you’re called a software engineer,an analyst, or a modeler) to elaborate on\\nbasic requirements established during the inception, elicitation, and negotiation\\ntasks that are part of requirements engineering (Chapter 5).\\nThe requirements modeling action results in one or more of the following types\\nof models:\\n• Scenario-based models of requirements from the point of view of various\\nsystem “actors”\\n• Data models that depict the information domain for the problem\\n• Class-oriented models that represent object-oriented classes (attributes and\\noperations) and the manner in which classes collaborate to achieve system\\nrequirements\\n• Flow-oriented models that represent the functional elements of the system\\nand how they transform data as it moves through the system\\n• Behavioral models that depict how the software behaves as a consequence of\\nexternal “events”\\nThese models provide a software designer with information that can be translated\\nto architectural, interface, and component-level designs. Finally, the requirements\\nmodel (and the software requirements specification) provides the developer and the\\ncustomer with the means to assess quality once software is built.\\nIn this chapter, I focus on scenario-based modeling —a technique that is growing\\nincreasingly popular throughout the software engineering community; data\\nmodeling—a more specialized technique that is particularly appropriate when an\\napplication must create or manipulate a complex information space; and class\\nCHAPTER 6 REQUIREMENTS MODELING: SCENARIOS, INFORMATION, AND ANALYSIS CLASSES 149\\nrequirements\\nmodeling  . . . . . .153\\nscenario-based\\nmodeling  . . . . . .154\\nswimlane\\ndiagram  . . . . . . .162\\nUML models  . . . .161\\nuse cases  . . . . . .156\\nuote:\\n“Any one ‘view’\\nof requirements\\nis insufficient\\nto understand\\nor describe the\\ndesired behavior of\\na complex system.”\\nAlan M.

Flow-oriented models, behavioral models,\\npattern-based modeling, and WebApp models are discussed in Chapter 7.\\n6.1.1 Overall Objectives and Philosophy\\nThroughout requirements modeling, your primary focus is on what, not how. What\\nuser interaction occurs in a particular circumstance, what objects does the system\\nmanipulate, what functions must the system perform, what behaviors does the sys-\\ntem exhibit, what interfaces are defined, and what constraints apply?\\n2\\nIn earlier chapters, I noted that complete specification of requirements may not\\nbe possible at this stage. The customer may be unsure of precisely what is required\\nfor certain aspects of the system. The developer may be unsure that a specific ap-\\nproach will properly accomplish function and performance. These realities mitigate\\nin favor of an iterative approach to requirements analysis and modeling. The analyst\\nshould model what is known and use that model as the basis for design of the soft-\\nware increment.\\n3\\nThe requirements model must achieve three primary objectives: (1) to describe\\nwhat the customer requires, (2) to establish a basis for the creation of a software de-\\nsign, and (3) to define a set of requirements that can be validated once the software\\nis built. The analysis model bridges the gap between a system-level description that\\ndescribes overall system or business functionality as it is achieved by applying soft-\\nware, hardware, data, human, and other system elements and a software design\\n(Chapters 8 through 13) that describes the software’s application architecture, user in-\\nterface, and component-level structure. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 6.1.\\nuote:\\n“Requirements are\\nnot architecture.\\nRequirements\\nare not design, nor\\nare they the\\nuser interface.\\nRequirements are\\nneed.”\\nAndrew Hunt\\nand David\\nThomas\\n2 It should be noted that as customers become more technologically sophisticated, there is a trend\\ntoward the specification of how as well as what. However, the primary focus should remain on\\nwhat.\\n3 Alternatively, the software team may choose to create a prototype (Chapter 2) in an effort to better\\nunderstand requirements for the system.\\nThe analysis model\\nshould describe what\\nthe customer wants,\\nestablish a basis for\\ndesign, and establish a\\ntarget for validation.\\nSystem\\ndescription\\nAnalysis\\nmodel\\nDesign\\nmodel\\nFIGURE 6.1\\nThe\\nrequirements\\nmodel as\\na bridge\\nbetween the\\nsystem\\ndescription\\nand the design\\nmodel\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 150'),\n",

A clear division of analysis and design tasks\\nbetween these two important modeling activities is not always possible. Some\\ndesign invariably occurs as part of analysis, and some analysis will be conducted\\nduring design.\\n6.1.2 Analysis Rules of Thumb\\nArlow and Neustadt [Arl02] suggest a number of worthwhile rules of thumb that\\nshould be followed when creating the analysis model:\\n• The model should focus on requirements that are visible within the problem or\\nbusiness domain. The level of abstraction should be relatively high. “Don’t get\\nbogged down in details” [Arl02] that try to explain how the system will work.\\n• Each element of the requirements model should add to an overall understanding\\nof software requirements and provide insight into the information domain,\\nfunction, and behavior of the system.\\n• Delay consideration of infrastructure and other nonfunctional models until\\ndesign. That is, a database may be required, but the classes necessary to\\nimplement it, the functions required to access it, and the behavior that will be\\nexhibited as it is used should be considered only after problem domain\\nanalysis has been completed.\\n• Minimize coupling throughout the system. It is important to represent relation-\\nships between classes and functions. However, if the level of “interconnect-\\nedness” is extremely high, effort should be made to reduce it.\\n• Be certain that the requirements model provides value to all stakeholders. Each\\nconstituency has its own use for the model. For example, business stake-\\nholders should use the model to validate requirements; designers should use\\nthe model as a basis for design; QA people should use the model to help plan\\nacceptance tests.\\n• Keep the model as simple as it can be. Don’t create additional diagrams when\\nthey add no new information. Don’t use complex notational forms, when a\\nsimple list will do.\\n6.1.3 Domain Analysis\\nIn the discussion of requirements engineering (Chapter 5), I noted that analysis pat-\\nterns often reoccur across many applications within a specific business domain. If\\nthese patterns are defined and categorized in a manner that allows you to recognize\\nand apply them to solve common problems, the creation of the analysis model is\\nexpedited. More important, the likelihood of applying design patterns and executa-\\nble software components grows dramatically. This improves time-to-market and\\nreduces development costs.\\nCHAPTER 6 REQUIREMENTS MODELING: SCENARIOS, INFORMATION, AND ANALYSIS CLASSES 151\\nuote:\\n“Problems worthy\\nof attack, prove\\ntheir worth by\\nhitting back.”\\nPiet Hein\\nWebRef\\nMany useful resources\\nfor domain analysis \\ncan be found at\\nwww.iturls\\n.com/English/\\nSoftware\\nEngineering/\\nSE_mod5.asp.\\nAre there\\nbasic \\nguidelines that\\ncan help us as we\\ndo requirements\\nanalysis work?\\n?\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 151'),\n",

Who de-\\nfines them, categorizes them, and readies them for use on subsequent projects? The\\nanswers to these questions lie in domain analysis. Firesmith [Fir93] describes domain\\nanalysis in the following way:\\nSoftware domain analysis is the identification, analysis, and specification of common re-\\nquirements from a specific application domain, typically for reuse on multiple projects\\nwithin that application domain. . . . [Object-oriented domain analysis is] the identification,\\nanalysis, and specification of common, reusable capabilities within a specific application\\ndomain, in terms of common objects, classes, subassemblies, and frameworks.\\nThe “specific application domain” can range from avionics to banking, from multi-\\nmedia video games to software embedded within medical devices. The goal of do-\\nmain analysis is straightforward: to find or create those analysis classes and/or\\nanalysis patterns that are broadly applicable so that they may be reused.\\n4\\nUsing terminology that was introduced earlier in this book, domain analysis may\\nbe viewed as an umbrella activity for the software process. By this I mean that do-\\nmain analysis is an ongoing software engineering activity that is not connected to\\nany one software project. In a way, the role of a domain analyst is similar to the role\\nof a master toolsmith in a heavy manufacturing environment. The job of the tool-\\nsmith is to design and build tools that may be used by many people doing similar but\\nnot necessarily the same jobs. The role of the domain analyst\\n5 is to discover and de-\\nfine analysis patterns, analysis classes, and related information that may be used by\\nmany people working on similar but not necessarily the same applications.\\nFigure 6.2 [Ara89] illustrates key inputs and outputs for the domain analysis\\nprocess. Sources of domain knowledge are surveyed in an attempt to identify objects\\nthat can be reused across the domain.\\nDomain analysis\\ndoesn’t look at a\\nspecific application, but\\nrather at the domain in\\nwhich the application\\nresides. The intent is\\nto identify common\\nproblem solving\\nelements that are\\napplicable to all\\napplications within\\nthe domain.\\nDomain\\nanalysis\\nSources of\\ndomain\\nknowledge\\nCustomer surveys\\nExpert advice\\nCurrent/future requirements\\nExisting applications\\nTechnical literature\\nDomain\\nanalysis\\nmodel\\nFunctional models\\nDomain languages\\nReuse standards\\nClass taxonomies\\nFIGURE 6.2 Input and output for domain analysis\\n4 A complementary view of domain analysis “involves modeling the domain so that software engi-\\nneers and other stakeholders can better learn about it . . . not all domain classes necessarily result\\nin the development of reusable classes . . .” [Let03a].\\n5 Do not make the assumption that because a domain analyst is at work, a software engineer need\\nnot understand the application domain. Every member of a software team should have some un-\\nderstanding of the domain in which the software is to be placed.\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 152'),\n",

Data objects are modeled\\nin a way that defines their attributes and relationships. Processes that manipulate\\ndata objects are modeled in a manner that shows how they transform data as data\\nobjects flow through the system.\\nA second approach to analysis modeling, called object-oriented analysis, focuses\\non the definition of classes and the manner in which they collaborate with one an-\\nother to effect customer requirements. UML and the Unified Process (Chapter 2) are\\npredominantly object oriented.\\nAlthough the requirements model proposed in this book combines features of\\nboth approaches, software teams often choose one approach and exclude all repre-\\nsentations from the other. The question is not which is best, but rather, what\\nuote:\\n“… analysis is\\nfrustrating, full\\nof complex\\ninterpersonal\\nrelationships,\\nindefinite, and\\ndifficult.

Behavioral elements depict how external events change\\nthe state of the system or the classes that reside within it.

Hence, requirements modeling with UML 6 begins with the creation of sce-\\nnarios in the form of use cases, activity diagrams, and swimlane diagrams.\\n6.2.1 Creating a Preliminary Use Case\\nAlistair Cockburn characterizes a use case as a “contract for behavior” [Coc01b]. As\\nwe discussed in Chapter 5, the “contract” defines the way in which an actor7 uses a\\ncomputer-based system to accomplish some goal. In essence, a use case captures\\nthe interactions that occur between producers and consumers of information and\\nthe system itself. In this section, I examine how use cases are developed as part\\nof the requirements modeling activity.\\n8\\nIn Chapter 5, I noted that a use case describes a specific usage scenario in straight-\\nforward language from the point of view of a defined actor. But how do you know\\n(1) what to write about, (2) how much to write about it, (3) how detailed to make your\\ndescription, and (4) how to organize the description? These are the questions that\\nmust be answered if use cases are to provide value as a requirements modeling tool.\\nWhat to write about? The first two requirements engineering tasks—inception\\nand elicitation—provide you with the information you’ll need to begin writing use\\ncases. Requirements gathering meetings, QFD, and other requirements engineering\\nmechanisms are used to identify stakeholders, define the scope of the problem, spec-\\nify overall operational goals, establish priorities, outline all known functional re-\\nquirements, and describe the things (objects) that will be manipulated by the system.\\nTo begin developing a set of use cases, list the functions or activities performed\\nby a specific actor. You can obtain these from a list of required system functions,\\nthrough conversations with stakeholders, or by an evaluation of activity diagrams\\n(Section 6.3.1) developed as part of requirements modeling.\\nCHAPTER 6 REQUIREMENTS MODELING: SCENARIOS, INFORMATION, AND ANALYSIS CLASSES 155\\nuote:\\n“[Use cases] are\\nsimply an aid to\\ndefining what\\nexists outside the\\nsystem (actors)\\nand what should be\\nperformed by the\\nsystem (use\\ncases).”\\nIvar Jacobson\\nIn some situations, use\\ncases become the\\ndominant requirements\\nengineering\\nmechanism. However,\\nthis does not mean\\nthat you should discard\\nother modeling\\nmethods when they\\nare appropriate.\\n6 UML will be used as the modeling notation throughout this book. Appendix 1 provides a brief tuto-\\nrial for those readers who may be unfamiliar with basic UML notation.\\n7 An actor is not a specific person, but rather a role that a person (or a device) plays within a specific\\ncontext. An actor “calls on the system to deliver one of its services” [Coc01b].\\n8 Use cases are a particularly important part of analysis modeling for user interfaces.

The system displays the floor plan of the house.\\nCan the actor take some other action at this point?The answer is “yes.” Referring to\\nthe free-flowing narrative, the actor may choose to view thumbnail snapshots of all\\ncameras simultaneously. Hence, one secondary scenario might be  “View thumbnail\\nsnapshots for all cameras.”\\nIs it possible that the actor will encounter some error condition at this point? Any\\nnumber of error conditions can occur as a computer-based system operates. In this\\ncontext, we consider only error conditions that are likely as a direct result of the ac-\\ntion described in step 6 or step 7. Again the answer to the question is “yes.” A floor\\nplan with camera icons may have never been configured. Hence, selecting “pick a\\ncamera” results in an error condition: “No floor plan configured for this house.”\\n9 This\\nerror condition becomes a secondary scenario.\\nIs it possible that the actor will encounter some other behavior at this point? Again\\nthe answer to the question is “yes.” As steps 6 and 7 occur, the system may encounter\\nan alarm condition. This would result in the system displaying a special alarm noti-\\nfication (type, location, system action) and providing the actor with a number of op-\\ntions relevant to the nature of the alarm. Because this secondary scenario can occur\\nat any time for virtually all interactions, it will not become part of the ACS-DCVuse\\ncase. Rather, a separate use case—Alarm condition encountered —would be de-\\nveloped and referenced from other use cases as required.\\nHow do I\\nexamine\\nalternative\\ncourses of action\\nwhen I develop a\\nuse case?\\n?\\n9 In this case, another actor, the system administrator, would have to configure the floor plan,\\ninstall and initialize (e.g., assign an equipment ID) all cameras, and test each camera to be certain\\nthat it is accessible via the system and through the floor plan.\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 158'),\n",

An exceptiondescribes a situation (either a failure condition or\\nan alternative chosen by the actor) that causes the system to exhibit somewhat\\ndifferent behavior.\\nCockburn [Coc01b] recommends using a “brainstorming” session to derive a\\nreasonably complete set of exceptions for each use case. In addition to the three\\ngeneric questions suggested earlier in this section, the following issues should also\\nbe explored:\\n• Are there cases in which some “validation function” occurs during this use case?\\nThis implies that validation function is invoked and a potential error condition\\nmight occur.\\n• Are there cases in which a supporting function (or actor) will fail to respond\\nappropriately? For example, a user action awaits a response but the function\\nthat is to respond times out.\\n• Can poor system performance result in unexpected or improper user actions? For\\nexample, a Web-based interface responds too slowly, resulting in a user\\nmaking multiple selects on a processing button. These selects queue inap-\\npropriately and ultimately generate an error condition.\\nThe list of extensions developed as a consequence of asking and answering these\\nquestions should be “rationalized” [Co01b] using the following criteria: an exception\\nshould be noted within the use case if the software can detect the condition\\ndescribed and then handle the condition once it has been detected. In some cases,\\nan exception will precipitate the development of another use case (to handle the\\ncondition noted).\\n6.2.3 Writing a Formal Use Case\\nThe informal use cases presented in Section 6.2.1 are sometimes sufficient for\\nrequirements modeling. However, when a use case involves a critical activity or\\ndescribes a complex set of steps with a significant number of exceptions, a more for-\\nmal approach may be desirable.\\nThe ACS-DCV use case shown in the sidebar follows a typical outline for formal\\nuse cases. The goal in context identifies the overall scope of the use case. The\\nprecondition describes what is known to be true before the use case is initiated.\\nThe trigger identifies the event or condition that “gets the use case started” [Coc01b].\\nThe scenario lists the specific actions that are required by the actor and the appro-\\npriate system responses. Exceptions identify the situations uncovered as the prelim-\\ninary use case is refined (Section 6.2.2). Additional headings may or may not be\\nincluded and are reasonably self-explanatory.\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 159'),\n",

But a procedural\\nview of requirements represents only a single dimension of a system. In Section 6.4,\\nI examine the information space and how data requirements can be represented.\\n6.4 D ATA MODELING CONCEPTS\\nIf software requirements include the need to create, extend, or interface with a data-\\nbase or if complex data structures must be constructed and manipulated, the soft-\\nware team may choose to create a data model as part of overall requirements\\nmodeling. A software engineer or analyst defines all data objects that are processed\\nwithin the system, the relationships between the data objects, and other information\\nthat is pertinent to the relationships. The entity-relationship diagram(ERD) addresses\\nthese issues and represents all data objects that are entered, stored, transformed,\\nand produced within an application.\\n6.4.1 Data Objects\\nA data object is a representation of composite information that must be understood\\nby software. By composite information, I mean something that has a number of dif-\\nferent properties or attributes. Therefore, width (a single value) would not be a valid\\ndata object, but dimensions (incorporating height, width, and depth) could be\\ndefined as an object.\\nA data object can be an external entity (e.g., anything that produces or consumes\\ninformation), a thing (e.g., a report or a display), an occurrence (e.g., a telephone\\ncall) or event (e.g., an alarm), a role (e.g., salesperson), an organizational unit (e.g.,\\naccounting department), a place (e.g., a warehouse), or a structure (e.g., a file). For\\nexample, a person or a car can be viewed as a data object in the sense that either\\ncan be defined in terms of a set of attributes. The description of the data object\\nincorporates the data object and all of its attributes.\\nA data object encapsulates data only—there is no reference within a data object\\nto operations that act on the data.\\n10 Therefore, the data object can be represented as\\na table as shown in Figure 6.7. The headings in the table reflect attributes of the ob-\\nject. In this case, a car is defined in terms of make, model, ID number, body type, color,\\nand owner. The body of the table represents specific instances of the data object. For\\nexample, a Chevy Corvette is an instance of the data object car.\\n6.4.2 Data Attributes\\nData attributesdefine the properties of a data object and take on one of three different\\ncharacteristics. They can be used to (1) name an instance of the data object, (2) describe\\nthe instance, or (3) make reference to another instance in another table. In addition,\\none or more of the attributes must be defined as an identifier—that is, the identifier\\nWebRef\\nUseful information on\\ndata modeling can be\\nfound at www\\n.datamodel.org.\\nHow does a\\ndata object\\nmanifest itself\\nwithin the context\\nof an application?\\n?\\nA data object is a\\nrepresentation of any\\ncomposite information\\nthat is processed by\\nsoftware.\\nAttributes name a data\\nobject, describe its\\ncharacteristics, and in\\nsome cases, make\\nreference to another\\nobject.\\n10 This distinction separates the data object from the class or object defined as part of the object-\\noriented approach (Appendix 2).\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 164'),\n",

In the latter case, the attributes for carmight also include ID\\nnumber, body type,and color, but many additional attributes (e.g., interior code, drive train\\ntype, trim package designator, transmission type) would have to be added to make car a\\nmeaningful object in the manufacturing control context.\\nA common question occurs when data objects\\nare discussed: Is a data object the same thing\\nas an object-oriented11 class?

A connection is established between person and car\\nbecause the two objects are related. But what are the relationships? To determine the\\nanswer, you should understand the role of people (owners, in this case) and cars\\nwithin the context of the software to be built. You can establish a set of object/\\nrelationship pairs that define the relevant relationships. For example,\\n• A person owns a car.\\n• A person is insured to drive a car.\\nThe relationships owns and insured to drive define the relevant connections between\\nperson and car. Figure 6.8b illustrates these object-relationship pairs graphically.\\nThe arrows noted in Figure 6.8b provide important information about the direction-\\nality of the relationship and often reduce ambiguity or misinterpretations.\\n12 Although the ERD is still used in some database design applications, UML notation (Appendix 1)\\ncan now be used for data design.\\n13 The cardinality of an object-relationship pair specifies “the number of occurrences of one [object]\\nthat can be related to the number of occurrences of another [object]” {Til93]. The modality of a re-\\nlationship is 0 if there is no explicit need for the relationship to occur or the relationship is optional.\\nThe modality is 1 if an occurrence of the relationship is mandatory.\\nRelationships indicate\\nthe manner in which\\ndata objects are\\nconnected to one\\nanother.\\nEntity-Relationship Diagrams\\nThe object-relationship pair is the cornerstone\\nof the data model.

A set of\\nprimary components is identified for the ERD: data objects,\\nattributes, relationships, and various type indicators. The\\nprimary purpose of the ERD is to represent data objects\\nand their relationships.\\nRudimentary ERD notation has already been\\nintroduced. Data objects are represented by a labeled\\nrectangle. Relationships are indicated with a labeled line\\nconnecting objects. In some variations of the ERD, the\\nconnecting line contains a diamond that is labeled with the\\nrelationship. Connections between data objects and\\nrelationships are established using a variety of special\\nsymbols that indicate cardinality and modality.\\n13 If you\\ndesire further information about data modeling and the\\nentity-relationship diagram, see [Hob06] or [Sim05].\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 166'),\n",

Analysis\\nclasses manifest themselves in one of the following ways:\\n• External entities (e.g., other systems, devices, people) that produce or\\nconsume information to be used by a computer-based system.\\n• Things (e.g., reports, displays, letters, signals) that are part of the information\\ndomain for the problem.\\n• Occurrences or events (e.g., a property transfer or the completion of a series\\nof robot movements) that occur within the context of system operation.\\n• Roles (e.g., manager, engineer, salesperson) played by people who interact\\nwith the system.\\n• Organizational units (e.g., division, group, team) that are relevant to an appli-\\ncation.\\n• Places (e.g., manufacturing floor or loading dock) that establish the context of\\nthe problem and the overall function of the system.\\n• Structures (e.g., sensors, four-wheeled vehicles, or computers) that define a\\nclass of objects or related classes of objects.\\nThis categorization is but one of many that have been proposed in the literature. 15\\nFor example, Budd [Bud96] suggests a taxonomy of classes that includes producers\\n(sources) and consumers (sinks) of data, data managers, viewor observer classes, and\\nhelper classes.\\nIt is also important to note what classes or objects are not. In general, a class\\nshould never have an “imperative procedural name” [Cas89]. For example, if the de-\\nvelopers of software for a medical imaging system defined an object with the name\\nInvertImage or even ImageInversion,they would be making a subtle mistake. The\\nImage obtained from the software could, of course, be a class (it is a thing that is\\npart of the information domain). Inversion of the image is an operation that is ap-\\nplied to the object. It is likely that inversion would be defined as an operation for the\\nobject Image, but it would not be defined as a separate class to connote “image\\ninversion.” As Cashman [Cas89] states: “the intent of object-orientation is to encap-\\nsulate, but still keep separate, data and operations on the data.”\\nTo illustrate how analysis classes might be defined during the early stages of mod-\\neling, consider a grammatical parse (nouns are underlined, verbs italicized) for a\\nprocessing narrative\\n16 for the SafeHome security function.\\nHow do\\nanalysis\\nclasses manifest\\nthemselves as\\nelements of the\\nsolution space?\\n?\\n15 Another important categorization, defining entity, boundary, and controller classes, is discussed in\\nSection 6.5.4.\\n16 A processing narrative is similar to the use case in style but somewhat different in purpose. The\\nprocessing narrative provides an overall description of the function to be developed. It is not a sce-\\nnario written from one actor’s point of view. It is important to note, however, that a grammatical\\nparse can also be used for every use case developed as part of requirements gathering (elicitation).\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 168'),\n",

The decision\\nfor inclusion of potential classes in the analysis model is somewhat subjective, and\\nlater evaluation may cause an object to be discarded or reinstated. However, the first\\nstep of class-based modeling is the definition of classes, and decisions (even sub-\\njective ones) must be made. With this in mind, you should apply the selection char-\\nacteristics to the list of potential SafeHome classes:\\nPotential Class Characteristic Number That Applies\\nhomeowner rejected: 1, 2 fail even though 6 applies\\nsensor accepted: all apply\\ncontrol panel accepted: all apply\\ninstallation rejected\\nsystem (alias security function) accepted: all apply\\nnumber, type rejected: 3 fails, attributes of sensor\\nmaster password rejected: 3 fails\\ntelephone number rejected: 3 fails\\nsensor event accepted: all apply\\naudible alarm accepted: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 apply\\nmonitoring service rejected: 1, 2 fail even though 6 applies\\nIt should be noted that (1) the preceding list is not all-inclusive, additional classes\\nwould have to be added to complete the model; (2) some of the rejected potential\\nclasses will become attributes for those classes that were accepted (e.g., numberand\\ntype are attributes of Sensor, and master password and telephone number may become\\nattributes of System); (3) different statements of the problem might cause different\\n“accept or reject” decisions to be made (e.g., if each homeowner had an individual\\npassword or was identified by voice print, the Homeownerclass would satisfy char-\\nacteristics 1 and 2 and would have been accepted).\\nuote:\\n“Classes struggle,\\nsome classes\\ntriumph, others are\\neliminated.”\\nMao Zedong\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 170'),\n",

In essence, it is the attributes that define the class—that clarify what is\\nmeant by the class in the context of the problem space. For example, if we were to\\nbuild a system that tracks baseball statistics for professional baseball players, the\\nattributes of the class Player would be quite different than the attributes of the\\nsame class when it is used in the context of the professional baseball pension sys-\\ntem. In the former, attributes such as name, position, batting average, fielding percentage,\\nyears played, and games played might be relevant. For the latter, some of these attrib-\\nutes would be meaningful, but others would be replaced (or augmented) by attrib-\\nutes like average salary, credit toward full vesting, pension plan options chosen, mailing\\naddress, and the like.\\nTo develop a meaningful set of attributes for an analysis class, you should study\\neach use case and select those “things” that reasonably “belong” to the class. In ad-\\ndition, the following question should be answered for each class: “What data items\\n(composite and/or elementary) fully define this class in the context of the problem\\nat hand?”\\nTo illustrate, we consider the System class defined for SafeHome. A homeowner\\ncan configure the security function to reflect sensor information, alarm response\\ninformation, activation/deactivation information, identification information, and so\\nforth. We can represent these composite data items in the following manner:\\nidentification information /H11549system ID /H11545verification phone number /H11545system status\\nalarm response information /H11549delay time /H11545telephone number\\nactivation/deactivation information /H11549master password /H11545number of allowable tries /H11545\\ntemporary password\\nEach of the data items to the right of the equal sign could be further defined to an\\nelementary level, but for our purposes, they constitute a reasonable list of attributes\\nfor the System class (shaded portion of Figure 6.9).\\nSensors are part of the overall SafeHome system, and yet they are not listed as\\ndata items or as attributes in Figure 6.9. Sensorhas already been defined as a class,\\nand multiple Sensor objects will be associated with the System class. In general,\\nwe avoid defining an item as an attribute if more than one of the items is to be as-\\nsociated with the class.\\n6.5.3 Defining Operations\\nOperations define the behavior of an object. Although many different types of oper-\\nations exist, they can generally be divided into four broad categories: (1) operations\\nthat manipulate data in some way (e.g., adding, deleting, reformatting, selecting), \\n(2) operations that perform a computation, (3) operations that inquire about the state\\nCHAPTER 6 REQUIREMENTS MODELING: SCENARIOS, INFORMATION, AND ANALYSIS CLASSES 171\\nAttributes are the set\\nof data objects that\\nfully define the class\\nwithin the context of\\nthe problem.\\nWhen you define\\noperations for an\\nanalysis class, focus on\\nproblem-oriented\\nbehavior rather than\\nbehaviors required for\\nimplementation.\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 171'),\n",

These functions are accomplished by operating on attributes and/or\\nassociations (Section 6.5.5). Therefore, an operation must have “knowledge” of the\\nnature of the class’ attributes and associations.\\nAs a first iteration at deriving a set of operations for an analysis class, you can\\nagain study a processing narrative (or use case) and select those operations that rea-\\nsonably belong to the class. To accomplish this, the grammatical parse is again stud-\\nied and verbs are isolated. Some of these verbs will be legitimate operations and can\\nbe easily connected to a specific class. For example, from the SafeHome processing\\nnarrative presented earlier in this chapter, we see that “sensor is assigned a number\\nand type” or “a master password is programmed for arming and disarming the\\nsystem.” These phrases indicate a number of things:\\n• That an assign() operation is relevant for the Sensor class.\\n• That a program() operation will be applied to the System class.\\n• That arm() and disarm() are operations that apply to System class.\\nUpon further investigation, it is likely that the operation program()will be divided into\\na number of more specific suboperations required to configure the system. For ex-\\nample, program() implies specifying phone numbers, configuring system character-\\nistics (e.g., creating the sensor table, entering alarm characteristics), and entering\\npassword(s). But for now, we specify program() as a single operation.\\nIn addition to the grammatical parse, you can gain additional insight into other\\noperations by considering the communication that occurs between objects. Objects\\ncommunicate by passing messages to one another.

Ambler [Amb95] describes CRC modeling in the following way:\\nA CRC model is really a collection of standard index cards that represent classes. The\\ncards are divided into three sections. Along the top of the card you write the name of the\\nclass. In the body of the card you list the class responsibilities on the left and the collab-\\norators on the right.\\nIn reality, the CRC model may make use of actual or virtual index cards. The intent is\\nto develop an organized representation of classes. Responsibilities are the attributes\\nand operations that are relevant for the class. Stated simply, a responsibility is\\n“anything the class knows or does” [Amb95]. Collaborators are those classes that are\\nuote:\\n“One purpose of\\nCRC cards is to fail\\nearly, to fail often,\\nand to fail\\ninexpensively.

Although this approach makes the flow of control in a\\nsystem straightforward, it has a few disadvantages: it concentrates all intelli-\\ngence within a few classes, making changes more difficult, and it tends to\\nrequire more classes, hence more development effort.\\nIf system intelligence is more evenly distributed across the classes in an\\napplication, each object knows about and does only a few things (that are\\ngenerally well focused), the cohesiveness of the system is improved.\\n17 This\\nenhances the maintainability of the software and reduces the impact of side\\neffects due to change.\\nTo determine whether system intelligence is properly distributed, the re-\\nsponsibilities noted on each CRC model index card should be evaluated to\\ndetermine if any class has an extraordinarily long list of responsibilities.

The first operation (responsibility) implies a complex mathematical\\nand logical procedure. The second is a simple clerical activity. Since these\\ntwo operations are not at the same level of abstraction, check-off-cleared-\\nchecks should be placed within the responsibilities of CheckEntry, a class\\nthat is encompassed by the aggregate class CheckingAccount.\\n2. Each responsibility should be stated as generally as possible. This\\nguideline implies that general responsibilities (both attributes and operations)\\nshould reside high in the class hierarchy (because they are generic, they will\\napply to all subclasses).\\n3. Information and the behavior related to it should reside within the\\nsame class. This achieves the object-oriented principle called encapsulation.\\nData and the processes that manipulate the data should be packaged as a\\ncohesive unit.\\n4. Information about one thing should be localized with a single class,\\nnot distributed across multiple classes. A single class should take on\\nthe responsibility for storing and manipulating a specific type of information.\\nThis responsibility should not, in general, be shared across a number of\\nclasses. If information is distributed, software becomes more difficult to\\nmaintain and more challenging to test.\\n17 Cohesiveness is a design concept that is discussed in Chapter 8.\\n18 In such cases, it may be necessary to spit the class into multiple classes or complete subsystems in\\norder to distribute intelligence more effectively.\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 176'),\n",

Responsibilities should be shared among related classes, when\\nappropriate. There are many cases in which a variety of related objects\\nmust all exhibit the same behavior at the same time. As an example, consider\\na video game that must display the following classes: Player, PlayerBody,\\nPlayerArms, PlayerLegs, PlayerHead. Each of these classes has its own\\nattributes (e.g., position, orientation, color, speed) and all must be updated and\\ndisplayed as the user manipulates a joystick. The responsibilities update()\\nand display() must therefore be shared by each of the objects noted. Player\\nknows when something has changed and update() is required. It collaborates\\nwith the other objects to achieve a new position or orientation, but each\\nobject controls its own display.\\nCollaborations. Classes fulfill their responsibilities in one of two ways: (1) A class\\ncan use its own operations to manipulate its own attributes, thereby fulfilling a par-\\nticular responsibility, or (2) a class can collaborate with other classes. Wirfs-Brock\\nand her colleagues [Wir90] define collaborations in the following way:\\nCollaborations represent requests from a client to a server in fulfillment of a client\\nresponsibility. A collaboration is the embodiment of the contract between the client and\\nthe server ....W e  say that an object collaborates with another object if, to fulfill a\\nresponsibility, it needs to send the other object any messages. A single collaboration\\nflows in one direction—representing a request from the client to the server. From the\\nclient’s point of view, each of its collaborations is associated with a particular responsi-\\nbility implemented by the server.\\nCollaborations are identified by determining whether a class can fulfill each respon-\\nsibility itself. If it cannot, then it needs to interact with another class. Hence, a\\ncollaboration.\\nAs an example, consider the SafeHome security function. As part of the activa-\\ntion procedure, the ControlPanel object must determine whether any sensors\\nare open. A responsibility named determine-sensor-status() is defined. If sensors are\\nopen, ControlPanel must set a status attribute to “not ready.” Sensor information\\ncan be acquired from each Sensor object. Therefore, the responsibility determine-\\nsensor-status() can be fulfilled only if ControlPanel works in collaboration with\\nSensor.\\nTo help in the identification of collaborators, you can examine three different\\ngeneric relationships between classes [Wir90]: (1) the is-part-of relationship, (2) the\\nhas-knowledge-of relationship, and (3) the depends-upon relationship. Each of the\\nthree generic relationships is considered briefly in the paragraphs that follow.\\nAll classes that are part of an aggregate class are connected to the aggregate class\\nvia an is-part-of relationship. Consider the classes defined for the video game noted\\nearlier, the class PlayerBody is-part-of Player, as are PlayerArms, PlayerLegs,\\nand PlayerHead. In UML, these relationships are represented as the aggregation\\nshown in Figure 6.12.\\nCHAPTER 6 REQUIREMENTS MODELING: SCENARIOS, INFORMATION, AND ANALYSIS CLASSES 177\\npre75977_ch06.qxd  11/27/08  3:34 PM  Page 177'),\n",

The determine-sensor-status() responsibility noted ear-\\nlier is an example of a has-knowledge-of relationship.\\nThe depends-upon relationship implies that two classes have a dependency that\\nis not achieved by has-knowledge-of or is-part-of. For example, PlayerHead must\\nalways be connected to PlayerBody (unless the video game is particularly violent),\\nyet each object could exist without direct knowledge of the other. An attribute of the\\nPlayerHead object called center-position is determined from the center position of\\nPlayerBody. This information is obtained via a third object, Player,that acquires it\\nfrom PlayerBody. Hence, PlayerHead depends-upon PlayerBody.\\nIn all cases, the collaborator class name is recorded on the CRC model index card\\nnext to the responsibility that has spawned the collaboration. Therefore, the index\\ncard contains a list of responsibilities and the corresponding collaborations that\\nenable the responsibilities to be fulfilled (Figure 6.11).\\nWhen a complete CRC model has been developed, stakeholders can review the\\nmodel using the following approach [Amb95]:\\n1. All participants in the review (of the CRC model) are given a subset of the\\nCRC model index cards. Cards that collaborate should be separated (i.e., no\\nreviewer should have two cards that collaborate).\\n2. All use-case scenarios (and corresponding use-case diagrams) should be\\norganized into categories.\\n3. The review leader reads the use case deliberately. As the review leader\\ncomes to a named object, she passes a token to the person holding the corre-\\nsponding class index card.

The requirements model bridges the gap between a system-level representation\\nthat describes overall system and business functionality and a software design that\\ndescribes the software’s application architecture, user interface, and component-\\nlevel structure.\\nScenario-based models depict software requirements from the user’s point of\\nview. The use case—a narrative or template-driven description of an interaction\\nbetween an actor and the software—is the primary modeling element. Derived\\nduring requirements elicitation, the use case defines the keys steps for a specific\\nfunction or interaction. The degree of use-case formality and detail varies, but the\\nend result provides necessary input to all other analysis modeling activities. Sce-\\nnarios can also be described using an activity diagram—a flowchart-like graphical\\nrepresentation that depicts the processing flow within a specific scenario. Swim-\\nlane diagrams illustrate how the processing flow is allocated to various actors or\\nclasses.\\nData modeling is used to describe the information space that will be constructed\\nor manipulated by the software. Data modeling begins by representing data\\nobjects—composite information that must be understood by the software. The\\nattributes of each data object are identified and relationships between data objects\\nare described.\\nClass-based modeling uses information derived from scenario-based and data\\nmodeling elements to identify analysis classes. A grammatical parse may be used to\\nextract candidate classes, attributes, and operations from text-based narratives.\\nCriteria for the definition of a class are defined. A set of class-responsibility-\\ncollaborator index cards can be used to define relationships between classes. In\\naddition, a variety of UML modeling notation can be applied to define hierarchies,\\nrelationships, associations, aggregations, and dependencies among classes.

A description follows:\\nCitizens can log onto a website and report the location and severity of potholes. As pot-\\nholes are reported they are logged within a “public works department repair system” and\\nare assigned an identifying number, stored by street address, size (on a scale of 1 to 10),\\nlocation (middle, curb, etc.), district (determined from street address), and repair prior-\\nity (determined from the size of the pothole).

Finally, a damage file is created to hold information about reported damage due\\nto the pothole and includes citizen’s name, address, phone number, type of damage, and\\ndollar amount of damage. PHTRS is an online system; all queries are to be made inter-\\nactively.\\na. Draw a UML use case diagram for the PHTRS system.

That is, data objects\\nflow into the software, are transformed by processing elements, and resultant data\\nobjects flow out of the software. Data objects are represented by labeled arrows, and\\ntransformations are represented by circles (also called bubbles). The DFD is pre-\\nsented in a hierarchical fashion.

As the DFD is refined into greater levels of detail, you perform an\\nimplicit functional decomposition of the system. At the same time, the DFD refine-\\nment results in a corresponding refinement of data as it moves through the processes\\nthat embody the application.\\nA few simple guidelines can aid immeasurably during the derivation of a data flow\\ndiagram: (1) the level 0 data flow diagram should depict the software/system as a\\nsingle bubble; (2) primary input and output should be carefully noted; (3) refinement\\nshould begin by isolating candidate processes, data objects, and data stores to be\\nrepresented at the next level; (4) all arrows and bubbles should be labeled with\\nmeaningful names; (5) information flow continuity must be maintained from level to\\nlevel,\\n2 and (6) one bubble at a time should be refined. There is a natural tendency to\\novercomplicate the data flow diagram. This occurs when you attempt to show too\\nmuch detail too early or represent procedural aspects of the software in lieu of\\ninformation flow.\\nTo illustrate the use of the DFD and related notation, we again consider the\\nSafeHome security function. A level 0 DFD for the security function is shown in\\nFigure 7.1. The primary external entities (boxes) produce information for use by the\\nsystem and consume information generated by the system. The labeled arrows rep-\\nresent data objects or data object hierarchies. For example, user commands and\\ndata encompasses all configuration commands, all activation/deactivation com-\\nmands, all miscellaneous interactions, and all data that are entered to qualify or\\nexpand a command.\\nThe level 0 DFD must now be expanded into a level 1 data flow model. But how\\ndo we proceed? Following an approach suggested in Chapter 6, you should apply a\\nuote:\\n“The purpose of\\ndata flow diagrams\\nis to provide a\\nsemantic bridge\\nbetween users\\nand systems\\ndevelopers.”\\nKenneth Kozar\\n2 That is, the data objects that flow into the system or into any transformation at one level must be the\\nsame data objects (or their constituent parts) that flow into the transformation at a more refined level.\\nInformation flow\\ncontinuity must be\\nmaintained as each\\nDFD level is refined.\\nThis means that input\\nand output at one level\\nmust be the same as\\ninput and output at a\\nrefined level.\\nControl\\npanel\\nUser commands\\nand data\\nSensors\\nSensor\\nstatus\\nControl\\npanel\\ndisplay\\nTelephone\\nline\\nAlarmSafeHome\\nsoftware\\nDisplay\\ninformation\\nTelephone\\nnumber tones\\nAlarm\\ntype\\nFIGURE 7.1\\nContext-level\\nDFD for the\\nSafeHome\\nsecurity\\nfunction\\npre75977_ch07.qxd  11/27/08  3:36 PM  Page 188'),\n",

That is, we isolate all nouns (and noun phrases) and verbs (and verb phrases)\\nin a SafeHome processing narrative derived during the first requirements gathering\\nmeeting. Recalling the parsed processing narrative text presented in Section 6.5.1:\\nThe SafeHome security function enables the homeowner to configure the security system\\nwhen it is installed, monitors all sensors connected to the security system, and interacts\\nwith the homeowner through the Internet, a PC, or a control panel.\\nDuring installation, the SafeHome PC is used to program and configure the system.\\nEach sensor is assigned a numberand type, a master passwordis programmed for arming\\nand disarming the system, and telephone number(s) are input for dialing when a sensor\\nevent occurs.\\nWhen a sensor event is recognized, the software invokes an audible alarm attached to\\nthe system. After a delaytime that is specified by the homeowner during system configura-\\ntion activities, the software dials a telephone number of a monitoring service, provides\\ninformationabout thelocation, reportingthe nature of the event that has been detected. The\\ntelephone number will beredialed every 20 seconds until telephoneconnectionis obtained.\\nThe homeowner receivessecurity informationvia a control panel, the PC, or a browser,\\ncollectively called an interface . The interface displays prompting messages and system\\nstatus information on the control panel, the PC, or the browser window. Homeowner in-\\nteraction takes the following form . . .\\nReferring to the grammatical parse, verbs are SafeHomeprocesses and can be rep-\\nresented as bubbles in a subsequent DFD. Nouns are either external entities (boxes),\\ndata or control objects (arrows), or data stores (double lines). From the discussion in\\nChapter 6, recall that nouns and verbs can be associated with one another (e.g., each\\nsensor is assigned a number and type; therefore numberand type are attributes of the\\ndata object sensor). Therefore, by performing a grammatical parse on the process-\\ning narrative for a bubble at any DFD level, you can generate much useful informa-\\ntion about how to proceed with the refinement to the next level. Using this\\ninformation, a level 1 DFD is shown in Figure 7.2. The context level process shown\\nin Figure 7.1 has been expanded into six processes derived from an examination of\\nthe grammatical parse. Similarly, the information flow between processes at level 1\\nhas been derived from the parse. In addition, information flow continuity is main-\\ntained between levels 0 and 1.\\nThe processes represented at DFD level 1 can be further refined into lower levels.\\nFor example, the process monitor sensorscan be refined into a level 2 DFD as shown\\nin Figure 7.3. Note once again that information flow continuity has been maintained\\nbetween levels.\\nThe refinement of DFDs continues until each bubble performs a simple function.\\nThat is, until the process represented by the bubble performs a function that would\\nbe easily implemented as a program component. In Chapter 8, I discuss a concept,\\ncalled cohesion, that can be used to assess the processing focus of a given function.\\nFor now, we strive to refine DFDs until each bubble is “single-minded.”\\nThe grammatical parse\\nis not foolproof, but it\\ncan provide you with an\\nexcellent jump start, if\\nyou’re struggling to\\ndefine data objects and\\nthe transforms that\\noperate on them.\\nBe certain that the\\nprocessing narrative\\nyou intend to parse is\\nwritten at the same\\nlevel of abstraction\\nthroughout.\\npre75977_ch07.qxd  11/27/08  3:36 PM  Page 189'),\n",

As I have al-\\nready noted, however, a large class of applications are “driven” by events rather than\\ndata, produce control information rather than reports or displays, and process infor-\\nmation with heavy concern for time and performance. Such applications require the\\nuse of control flow modeling in addition to data flow modeling.\\nI have already noted that an event or control item is implemented as a Boolean value\\n(e.g., true or false, on or off, 1 or 0) or a discrete list of conditions (e.g., empty, jammed,\\nfull). To select potential candidate events, the following guidelines are suggested:\\n• List all sensors that are “read” by the software.\\n• List all interrupt conditions.\\n• List all “switches” that are actuated by an operator.\\n• List all data conditions.\\n• Recalling the noun/verb parse that was applied to the processing narrative,\\nreview all “control items” as possible control specification inputs/outputs.\\n• Describe the behavior of a system by identifying its states, identify how each\\nstate is reached, and define the transitions between states.\\n• Focus on possible omissions—a very common error in specifying control; for\\nexample, ask: “Is there any other way I can get to this state or exit from it?”\\nAmong the many events and control items that are part of SafeHome software are\\nsensor event (i.e., a sensor has been tripped), blink flag (a signal to blink the\\ndisplay), and start/stop switch (a signal to turn the system on or off ).\\n7.2.3 The Control Specification\\nA control specification (CSPEC) represents the behavior of the system (at the level\\nfrom which it has been referenced) in two different ways. 3 The CSPEC contains a\\nstate diagram that is a sequential specification of behavior. It can also contain a pro-\\ngram activation table—a combinatorial specification of behavior.\\nFigure 7.4 depicts a preliminary state diagram\\n4 for the level 1 control flow model\\nfor SafeHome. The diagram indicates how the system responds to events as it trav-\\nerses the four states defined at this level. By reviewing the state diagram, you can\\ndetermine the behavior of the system and, more important, ascertain whether there\\nare “holes” in the specified behavior.\\nFor example, the state diagram (Figure 7.4) indicates that the transitions from\\nthe Idle state can occur if the system is reset, activated, or powered off.

It is now time to make a transition to the dynamic be-\\nhavior of the system or product. To accomplish this, you can represent the behavior\\nof the system as a function of specific events and time.\\nThe behavioral model indicates how software will respond to external events or\\nstimuli. To create the model, you should perform the following steps:\\n1. Evaluate all use cases to fully understand the sequence of interaction within\\nthe system.\\n2. Identify events that drive the interaction sequence and understand how these\\nevents relate to specific objects.\\n3. Create a sequence for each use case.\\n4. Build a state diagram for the system.\\n5. Review the behavioral model to verify accuracy and consistency.\\nEach of these steps is discussed in the sections that follow.\\n7.3.1 Identifying Events with the Use Case\\nIn Chapter 6 you learned that the use case represents a sequence of activities that in-\\nvolves actors and the system. In general, an event occurs whenever the system and\\nan actor exchange information. In Section 7.2.3, I indicated that an event is not the\\ninformation that has been exchanged, but rather the fact that information has been\\nexchanged.\\nA use case is examined for points of information exchange. To illustrate, we re-\\nconsider the use case for a portion of the SafeHome security function.\\nThe homeowner uses the keypad to key in a four-digit password . The password is\\ncompared with the valid password stored in the system. If the password is incorrect, the\\ncontrol panel will beep once and reset itself for additional input. If the password is\\ncorrect, the control panel awaits further action.\\nThe underlined portions of the use case scenario indicate events. An actor should be\\nidentified for each event; the information that is exchanged should be noted, and any\\nconditions or constraints should be listed.\\nAs an example of a typical event, consider the underlined use case phrase “home-\\nowner uses the keypad to key in a four-digit password.” In the context of the\\nrequirements model, the object, Homeowner,\\n7 transmits an event to the object\\nControlPanel. The event might be called password entered. The information\\nHow do I\\nmodel the\\nsoftware’s\\nreaction to some\\nexternal event?\\n?\\n7 In this example, we assume that each user (homeowner) that interacts with SafeHome has an\\nidentifying password and is therefore a legitimate object.\\npre75977_ch07.qxd  11/27/08  3:36 PM  Page 195'),\n",

It is important to note that some events have an ex-\\nplicit impact on the flow of control of the use case, while others have no direct im-\\npact on the flow of control. For example, the event password entered does not\\nexplicitly change the flow of control of the use case, but the results of the event\\npassword compared (derived from the interaction “password is compared with the\\nvalid password stored in the system”) will have an explicit impact on the information\\nand control flow of the SafeHome software.\\nOnce all events have been identified, they are allocated to the objects involved.\\nObjects can be responsible for generating events (e.g., Homeowner generates\\nthe password entered event) or recognizing events that have occurred elsewhere\\n(e.g., ControlPanel recognizes the binary result of the password compared event).\\n7.3.2 State Representations\\nIn the context of behavioral modeling, two different characterizations of states must\\nbe considered: (1) the state of each class as the system performs its function and\\n(2) the state of the system as observed from the outside as the system performs its\\nfunction.\\n8\\nThe state of a class takes on both passive and active characteristics [Cha93]. A\\npassive state is simply the current status of all of an object’s attributes. For example,\\nthe passive state of the class Player (in the video game application discussed in\\nChapter 6) would include the current position and orientation attributes of Player as\\nwell as other features of Player that are relevant to the game (e.g., an attribute that\\nindicates magic wishes remaining). The active stateof an object indicates the current sta-\\ntus of the object as it undergoes a continuing transformation or processing. The class\\nPlayer might have the following active states: moving, at rest, injured, being cured;\\ntrapped, lost, and so forth. An event (sometimes called a trigger) must occur to force\\nan object to make a transition from one active state to another.\\nTwo different behavioral representations are discussed in the paragraphs that\\nfollow. The first indicates how an individual class changes state based on external\\nevents and the second shows the behavior of the software as a function of time.\\nState diagrams for analysis classes. One component of a behavioral model is\\na UML state diagram\\n9 that represents active states for each class and the events (trig-\\ngers) that cause changes between these active states. Figure 7.6 illustrates a state di-\\nagram for the ControlPanel object in the SafeHome security function.\\nEach arrow shown in Figure 7.6 represents a transition from one active state of\\nan object to another. The labels shown for each arrow represent the event that\\n8 The state diagrams presented in Chapter 6 and in Section 7.3.2 depict the state of the system. Our\\ndiscussion in this section will focus on the state of each class within the analysis model.\\n9 If you are unfamiliar with UML, a brief introduction to this important modeling notation is presented\\nin Appendix 1.\\nThe system has states\\nthat represent specific\\nexternally observable\\nbehavior; a class has\\nstates that represent\\nits behavior as the\\nsystem performs its\\nfunctions.\\npre75977_ch07.qxd  11/27/08  3:36 PM  Page 196'),\n",

Although the active state model provides useful insight into\\nthe “life history” of an object, it is possible to specify additional information to pro-\\nvide more depth in understanding the behavior of an object. In addition to specify-\\ning the event that causes the transition to occur, you can specify a guard and an\\naction [Cha93]. A guard is a Boolean condition that must be satisfied in order for the\\ntransition to occur. For example, the guard for the transition from the “reading” state\\nto the “comparing” state in Figure 7.6 can be determined by examining the use case:\\nif (password input /H115494 digits) then compare to stored password\\nIn general, the guard for a transition usually depends upon the value of one or more\\nattributes of an object. In other words, the guard depends on the passive state of the\\nobject.\\nAn action occurs concurrently with the state transition or as a consequence of it\\nand generally involves one or more operations (responsibilities) of the object. For ex-\\nample, the action connected to the password entered event (Figure 7.6) is an opera-\\ntion named validatePassword() that accesses a password object and performs a\\ndigit-by-digit comparison to validate the entered password.\\nSequence diagrams. The second type of behavioral representation, called a\\nsequence diagram in UML, indicates how events cause transitions from object to\\nobject.

In essence, the sequence diagram is a short-\\nhand version of the use case. It represents key classes and the events that cause\\nbehavior to flow from class to class.\\nFigure 7.7 illustrates a partial sequence diagram for the SafeHome security func-\\ntion. Each of the arrows represents an event (derived from a use case) and indicates\\nhow the event channels behavior between SafeHome objects. Time is measured ver-\\ntically (downward), and the narrow vertical rectangles represent time spent in pro-\\ncessing an activity. States may be shown along a vertical time line.\\nThe first event, system ready, is derived from the external environment and chan-\\nnels behavior to the Homeowner object.

Ultimately, control is passed\\nback to the homeowner with the activation successful event.\\nOnce a complete sequence diagram has been developed, all of the events that\\ncause transitions between system objects can be collated into a set of input events\\nand output events (from an object). This information is useful in the creation of an\\neffective design for the system to be built.\\nUnlike a state diagram\\nthat represents\\nbehavior without\\nnoting the classes\\ninvolved, a sequence\\ndiagram represents\\nbehavior, by describing\\nhow classes move\\nfrom state to state.\\nControl panel System\\nSystem \\nready\\nReading\\nRequest lookupComparing\\nResult\\nPassword entered\\nPassword = correct\\nRequest activation\\nActivation successful\\nLocked\\nSelecting\\nTimer > lockedTime\\nA\\nA\\nActivation successful\\nHomeowner Sensors\\nnumberOfTries > maxTries\\nFIGURE 7.7 Sequence diagram (partial) for the SafeHome security function\\npre75977_ch07.qxd  11/27/08  3:36 PM  Page 198'),\n",

Each of these elements examines the problem from a different perspective, and\\neach provides an opportunity to discover patterns that may occur throughout an\\napplication domain, or by analogy, across different application domains.\\nThe most basic element in the description of a requirements model is the use case.\\nIn the context of this discussion, a coherent set of use cases may serve as the basis\\nfor discovering one or more analysis patterns. A semantic analysis pattern (SAP) “is a\\npattern that describes a small set of coherent use cases that together describe a basic\\ngeneric application” [Fer00].\\nConsider the following preliminary use case for software required to control and\\nmonitor a real-view camera and proximity sensor for an automobile:\\nUse case: Monitor reverse motion\\nDescription: When the vehicle is placed in reverse gear, the control software enables a\\nvideo feed from a rear-placed video camera to the dashboard display. The control soft-\\nware superimposes a variety of distance and orientation lines on the dashboard display\\nso that the vehicle operator can maintain orientation as the vehicle moves in reverse. The\\ncontrol software also monitors a proximity sensor to determine whether an object is\\ninside 10 feet of the rear of the vehicle. It will automatically break the vehicle if the prox-\\nimity sensor indicates an object within x feet of the rear of the vehicle, where x is deter-\\nmined based on the speed of the vehicle.\\nThis use case implies a variety of functionality that would be refined and elaborated\\n(into a coherent set of use cases) during requirements gathering and modeling.\\nRegardless of how much elaboration is accomplished, the use cases suggest a\\nsimple, yet widely applicable SAP—the software-based monitoring and control of\\nsensors and actuators in a physical system. In this case, the “sensors” provide infor-\\nmation about proximity and video information. The “actuator” is the breaking sys-\\ntem of the vehicle (invoked if an object is very close to the vehicle). But in a more\\ngeneral case, a widely applicable pattern is discovered.\\nSoftware in many different application domains is required to monitor sensors\\nand control physical actuators. It follows that an analysis pattern that describes\\ngeneric requirements for this capability could be used widely. The pattern, called\\nActuator-Sensor, would be applicable as part of the requirements model for\\nSafeHome and is discussed in Section 7.4.2, which follows.\\n7.4.2 A Requirements Pattern Example: Actuator-Sensor 12\\nOne of the requirements of the SafeHome security function is the ability to monitory\\nsecurity sensors (e.g., break-in sensors, fire, smoke or CO sensors, water sensors).\\n12 This section has been adapted from [Kon02] with the permission of the authors.\\npre75977_ch07.qxd  11/27/08  3:36 PM  Page 200'),\n",

It’ll slow us down just when we need to be\\ndesigning and building the WebApp.”\\nRequirements analysis does take time, but solving the wrong problem takes even\\nmore time. The question for every WebApp developer is simple—are you sure you\\nunderstand the requirements of the problem? If the answer is an unequivocal “yes,”\\nthen it may be possible to skip requirements modeling, but if the answer is “no,” then\\nrequirements modeling should be performed.\\n7.5.1 How Much Analysis Is Enough?\\nThe degree to which requirements modeling for WebApps is emphasized depends on\\nthe following factors:\\n• Size and complexity of WebApp increment.\\n• Number of stakeholders (analysis can help to identify conflicting requirements\\ncoming from different sources).\\n• Size of the WebApp team.\\n• Degree to which members of the WebApp team have worked together before\\n(analysis can help develop a common understanding of the project).\\n• Degree to which the organization’s success is directly dependent on the\\nsuccess of the WebApp.\\nThe converse of the preceding points is that as the project becomes smaller, the\\nnumber of stakeholders fewer, the development team more cohesive, and the appli-\\ncation less critical, it is reasonable to apply a more lightweight analysis approach.\\nAlthough it is a good idea to analyze the problem before beginning design, it is\\nnot true that all analysis must precede all design. In fact, the design of a specific part\\nof the WebApp only demands an analysis of those requirements that affect only that\\npart of the WebApp. As an example from SafeHome, you could validly design\\nthe overall website aesthetics (layouts, color schemes, etc.) without having\\nanalyzed the functional requirements for e-commerce capabilities. You only need to\\nanalyze that part of the problem that is relevant to the design work for the incre-\\nment to be delivered.\\nCHAPTER 7 REQUIREMENTS MODELING: FLOW, BEHAVIOR, PATTERNS, AND WEBAPPS 205\\n14 This section has been adapted from Pressman and Lowe [Pre08] with permission.\\npre75977_ch07.qxd  11/27/08  3:36 PM  Page 205'),\n",

The process incorporates a communication\\nactivity that identifies stakeholders and user categories, the business context, de-\\nfined informational and applicative goals, general WebApp requirements, and usage\\nscenarios—information that becomes input to requirements modeling. This infor-\\nmation is represented in the form of natural language descriptions, rough outlines,\\nsketches, and other informal representations.\\nAnalysis takes this information, structures it using a formally defined representa-\\ntion scheme (where appropriate), and then produces more rigorous models as an\\noutput. The requirements model provides a detailed indication of the true structure\\nof the problem and provides insight into the shape of the solution.\\nThe SafeHome ACS-DCV (camera surveillance) function was introduced in Chap-\\nter 6. When it was introduced, this function seemed relatively clear and was de-\\nscribed in some detail as part of a use case (Section 6.2.1). However, a reexamination\\nof the use case might uncover information that is missing, ambiguous, or unclear.\\nSome aspects of this missing information would naturally emerge during the\\ndesign. Examples might include the specific layout of the function buttons, their aes-\\nthetic look and feel, the size of snapshot views, the placement of camera views and\\nthe house floor plan, or even minutiae such as the maximum and minimum length\\nof passwords. Some of these aspects are design decisions (such as the layout of the\\nbuttons) and others are requirements (such as the length of the passwords) that don’t\\nfundamentally influence early design work.\\nBut some missing information might actually influence the overall design itself\\nand relate more to an actual understanding of the requirements. For example:\\nQ\\n1: What output video resolution is provided by SafeHome cameras?\\nQ2: What occurs if an alarm condition is encountered while the camera is\\nbeing monitored?\\nQ3: How does the system handle cameras that can be panned and zoomed?\\nQ4: What information should be provided along with the camera view? (For\\nexample, location? time/date? last previous access?)\\nNone of these questions were identified or considered in the initial development of\\nthe use case, and yet, the answers could have a substantial effect on different aspects\\nof the design.\\nTherefore, it is reasonable to conclude that although the communication activity\\nprovides a good foundation for understanding, requirements analysis refines this\\nunderstanding by providing additional interpretation. As the problem structure is de-\\nlineated as part of the requirements model, questions invariably arise. It is these\\nquestions that fill in the gaps—or in some cases, actually help us to find the gaps in\\nthe first place.\\npre75977_ch07.qxd  11/27/08  3:36 PM  Page 206'),\n",

While the specific\\nmodels depend largely upon the nature of the WebApp, there are five main classes\\nof models:\\n• Content model—identifies the full spectrum of content to be provided by\\nthe WebApp. Content includes text, graphics and images, video, and audio\\ndata.\\n• Interaction model—describes the manner in which users interact with the\\nWebApp.\\n• Functional model—defines the operations that will be applied to WebApp\\ncontent and describes other processing functions that are independent of\\ncontent but necessary to the end user.\\n• Navigation model—defines the overall navigation strategy for the WebApp.\\n• Configuration model—describes the environment and infrastructure in\\nwhich the WebApp resides.\\nYou can develop each of these models using a representation scheme (often\\ncalled a “language”) that allows its intent and structure to be communicated and\\nevaluated easily among members of the Web engineering team and other stake-\\nholders.

The content objects might be\\nstored as separate files, embedded directly into Web pages, or obtained dynamically\\nfrom a database. In other words, a content object is any item of cohesive informa-\\ntion that is to be presented to an end user.\\nContent objects can be determined directly from use cases by examining the\\nscenario description for direct and indirect references to content. For example, a\\nWebApp that supports SafeHome is established at SafeHomeAssured.com.

However, in some cases, the content model may benefit\\nfrom a richer analysis that graphically illustrates the relationships among content\\nobjects and/or the hierarchy of content maintained by a WebApp.\\nFor example, consider the data tree [Sri01] created for a SafeHomeAssured.com\\ncomponent shown in Figure 7.10.

The data tree is developed in an effort to define hierarchical\\nrelationships among content objects and to provide a means for reviewing content\\nso that omissions and inconsistencies are uncovered before design commences. In\\naddition, the data tree serves as the basis for content design.\\n7.5.5 Interaction Model for WebApps\\nThe vast majority of WebApps enable a “conversation” between an end user and ap-\\nplication functionality, content, and behavior. This conversation can be described\\nusing an interaction model that can be composed of one or more of the following\\nelements: (1) use cases, (2) sequence diagrams, (3) state diagrams,\\n16 and/or (4) user\\ninterface prototypes.\\nIn many instances, a set of use cases is sufficient to describe the interaction at an\\nanalysis level (further refinement and detail will be introduced during design). How-\\never, when the sequence of interaction is complex and involves multiple analysis\\nclasses or many tasks, it is sometimes worthwhile to depict it using a more rigorous\\ndiagrammatic form.\\nThe layout of the user interface, the content it presents, the interaction mecha-\\nnisms it implements, and the overall aesthetic of the user-WebApp connections have\\nmuch to do with user satisfaction and the overall success of the WebApp. Although\\nit can be argued that the creation of a user interface prototype is a design activity, it\\nis a good idea to perform it during the creation of the analysis model. The sooner that\\na physical representation of a user interface can be reviewed, the higher the likeli-\\nhood that end users will get what they want. The design of user interfaces is dis-\\ncussed in detail in Chapter 11.\\nBecause WebApp construction tools are plentiful, relatively inexpensive, and\\nfunctionally powerful, it is best to create the interface prototype using such tools.\\nThe prototype should implement the major navigational links and represent the\\noverall screen layout in much the same way that it will be constructed. For exam-\\nple, if five major system functions are to be provided to the end user, the prototype\\nshould represent them as the user will see them upon first entering the WebApp.\\nWill graphical links be provided? Where will the navigation menu be displayed?\\nWhat other information will the user see? Questions like these should be answered\\nby the prototype.\\nCHAPTER 7 REQUIREMENTS MODELING: FLOW, BEHAVIOR, PATTERNS, AND WEBAPPS 209\\n16 Sequence diagrams and state diagrams are modeled using UML notation.

For this reason, functional re-\\nquirements must be analyzed, and when necessary, modeled.\\nThe functional model addresses two processing elements of the WebApp, each\\nrepresenting a different level of procedural abstraction: (1) user-observable func-\\ntionality that is delivered by the WebApp to end users, and (2) the operations con-\\ntained within analysis classes that implement behaviors associated with the class.\\nUser-observable functionality encompasses any processing functions that are ini-\\ntiated directly by the user. For example, a financial WebApp might implement a va-\\nriety of financial functions (e.g., a college tuition savings calculator or a retirement\\nsavings calculator). These functions may actually be implemented using operations\\nwithin analysis classes, but from the point of view of the end user, the function (more\\ncorrectly, the data provided by the function) is the visible outcome.\\nAt a lower level of procedural abstraction, the requirements model describes the\\nprocessing to be performed by analysis class operations. These operations manipu-\\nlate class attributes and are involved as classes collaborate with one another to\\naccomplish some required behavior.\\nRegardless of the level of procedural abstraction, the UML activity diagram can\\nbe used to represent processing details. At the analysis level, activity diagrams\\nshould be used only where the functionality is relatively complex. Much of the com-\\nplexity of many WebApps occurs not in the functionality provided, but rather with\\nthe nature of the information that can be accessed and the ways in which this can\\nbe manipulated.\\nAn example of relatively complex functionality for SafeHomeAssured.com is\\naddressed by a use case entitled Get recommendations for sensor layout for my space.\\nThe user has already developed a layout for the space to be monitored, and in this\\nuse case, selects that layout and requests recommended locations for sensors within\\nthe layout. SafeHomeAssured.com responds with a graphical representation of the\\nlayout with additional information on the recommended locations for sensors. The\\ninteraction is quite simple, the content is somewhat more complex, but the underly-\\ning functionality it very sophisticated. The system must undertake a relatively com-\\nplex analysis of the floor layout in order to determine the optimal set of sensors. It\\nmust examine room dimensions, the location of doors and windows, and coordinate\\nthese with sensor capabilities and specifications. No small task! A set of activity\\ndiagrams can be used to describe processing for this use case.\\nThe second example is the use case Control cameras. In this use case, the inter-\\naction is relatively simple, but there is the potential for complex functionality, given\\nthat this “simple” operation requires complex communication with devices located\\nremotely and accessible across the Internet. A further possible complication relates\\npre75977_ch07.qxd  11/27/08  3:36 PM  Page 210'),\n",

The mechanics of navigation are\\ndefined as part of design. At this stage, you should focus on overall navigation\\nrequirements. The following questions should be considered:\\n• Should certain elements be easier to reach (require fewer navigation steps)\\nthan others? What is the priority for presentation?\\n• Should certain elements be emphasized to force users to navigate in their\\ndirection?\\n• How should navigation errors be handled?\\n• Should navigation to related groups of elements be given priority over\\nnavigation to a specific element?\\n• Should navigation be accomplished via links, via search-based access, or by\\nsome other means?\\n• Should certain elements be presented to users based on the context of\\nprevious navigation actions?\\n• Should a navigation log be maintained for users?\\n• Should a full navigation map or menu (as opposed to a single “back” link or\\ndirected pointer) be available at every point in a user’s interaction?\\n• Should navigation design be driven by the most commonly expected user\\nbehaviors or by the perceived importance of the defined WebApp elements?\\n• Can a user “store” his previous navigation through the WebApp to expedite\\nfuture usage?\\n• For which user category should optimal navigation be designed?\\n• How should links external to the WebApp be handled? Overlaying the\\nexisting browser window? As a new browser window? As a separate frame?\\nThese and many other questions should be asked and answered as part of navigation\\nanalysis.\\n17 Determining market share for browsers is notoriously problematic and varies depending on which\\nsurvey is used.

Will a user be\\nable to access content objects or functions based on defined attributes of those ele-\\nments (e.g., a user might want to access all photographs of a specific building or all\\nfunctions that allow computation of weight)?\\n7.6 S UMMARY\\nFlow-oriented models focus on the flow of data objects as they are transformed by\\nprocessing functions. Derived from structured analysis, flow-oriented models use\\nthe data flow diagram, a modeling notation that depicts how input is transformed\\ninto output as data objects move through a system. Each software function that\\ntransforms data is described by a process specification or narrative. In addition to\\ndata flow, this modeling element also depicts control flow—a representation that\\nillustrates how events affect the behavior of a system.\\nBehavioral modeling depicts dynamic behavior. The behavioral model uses input\\nfrom scenario-based, flow-oriented, and class-based elements to represent the\\nstates of analysis classes and the system as a whole. To accomplish this, states are\\nidentified, the events that cause a class (or the system) to make a transition from one\\nstate to another are defined, and the actions that occur as transition is accomplished\\nare also identified. State diagrams and sequence diagrams are the notation used for\\nbehavioral modeling.\\nAnalysis patterns enable a software engineer to use existing domain knowledge to\\nfacilitate the creation of a requirements model. An analysis pattern describes a spe-\\ncific software feature or function that can be described by a coherent set of use cases.\\nIt specifies the intent of the pattern, the motivation for its use, constraints that limit\\nits use, its applicability in various problem domains, the overall structure of the pat-\\ntern, its behavior and collaborations, and other supplementary information.\\nRequirements modeling for WebApps can use most, if not all, of the modeling el-\\nements discussed in this book. However, these elements are applied within a set of\\nspecialized models that address content, interaction, function, navigation, and the\\nclient-server configuration in which the WebApp resides.\\nPROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER\\n7.1.

In the early 1990s Mitch\\nKapor, the creator of Lotus 1-2-3, presented a “software design manifesto” in\\nDr. Dobbs Journal. He said:\\nWhat is design?

Design is what almost\\nevery engineer wants to do. It is the\\nplace where creativity rules—where\\nstakeholder requirements, business\\nneeds, and technical considerations all come\\ntogether in the formulation of a product or sys-\\ntem. Design creates a representation or model\\nof the software, but unlike the requirements\\nmodel (that focuses on describing required\\ndata, function, and behavior), the design model\\nprovides detail about software architecture,\\ndata structures, interfaces, and components that\\nare necessary to implement the system.\\nWho does it? Software engineers conduct each of\\nthe design tasks.\\nWhy is it important? Design allows you to model\\nthe system or product that is to be built. This\\nmodel can be assessed for quality and\\nimproved before code is generated, tests are\\nconducted, and end users become involved in\\nlarge numbers. Design is the place where soft-\\nware quality is established.\\nWhat are the steps? Design depicts the soft-\\nware in a number of different ways. First, the\\nQUICK\\nLOOK\\narchitecture of the system or product must be\\nrepresented. Then, the interfaces that connect\\nthe software to end users, to other systems and\\ndevices, and to its own constituent components\\nare modeled. Finally, the software components\\nthat are used to construct the system are\\ndesigned. Each of these views represents a dif-\\nferent design action, but all must conform to a\\nset of basic design concepts that guide software\\ndesign work.\\nWhat is the work product? A design model that\\nencompasses architectural, interface, component-\\nlevel, and deployment representations is the\\nprimary work product that is produced during\\nsoftware design.\\nHow do I ensure that I’ve done it right? The\\ndesign model is assessed by the software team\\nin an effort to determine whether it contains\\nerrors, inconsistencies, or omissions; whether\\nbetter alternatives exist; and whether the\\nmodel can be implemented within the con-\\nstraints, schedule, and cost that have been\\nestablished.\\nKEY\\nCONCEPTS\\nabstraction . . . .223\\narchitecture  . . .223\\naspects  . . . . . .228\\ncohesion . . . . . .227\\ndata design  . . .234\\ndesign process  .219\\nfunctional\\nindependence  . .227\\ngood design  . . .219\\ninformation \\nhiding  . . . . . . .226\\npre75977_ch08.qxd  11/27/08  3:38 PM  Page 215'),\n",

Commodity: A program should be suitable for the purposes for which it was in-\\ntended. Delight: The experience of using the program should be a pleasurable one. Here\\nwe have the beginnings of a theory of design for software.\\nThe goal of design is to produce a model or representation that exhibits firmness,\\ncommodity, and delight. To accomplish this, you must practice diversification and\\nthen convergence. Belady [Bel81] states that “diversification is the acquisition of a\\nrepertoire of alternatives, the raw material of design: components, component solu-\\ntions, and knowledge, all contained in catalogs, textbooks, and the mind.” Once this\\ndiverse set of information is assembled, you must pick and choose elements from the\\nrepertoire that meet the requirements defined by requirements engineering and the\\nanalysis model (Chapters 5 through 7). As this occurs, alternatives are considered\\nand rejected and you converge on “one particular configuration of components, and\\nthus the creation of the final product” [Bel81].\\nDiversification and convergence combine intuition and judgment based on expe-\\nrience in building similar entities, a set of principles and/or heuristics that guide the\\nway in which the model evolves, a set of criteria that enables quality to be judged,\\nand a process of iteration that ultimately leads to a final design representation.\\nSoftware design changes continually as new methods, better analysis, and broader\\nunderstanding evolve.\\n1 Even today, most software design methodologies lack the\\ndepth, flexibility, and quantitative nature that are normally associated with more clas-\\nsical engineering design disciplines.

Initially, the blueprint depicts a holis-\\ntic view of software. That is, the design is represented at a high level of abstraction—\\na level that can be directly traced to the specific system objective and more detailed\\ndata, functional, and behavioral requirements. As design iterations occur, subse-\\nquent refinement leads to design representations at much lower levels of abstraction.\\nThese can still be traced to requirements, but the connection is more subtle.\\n8.2.1 Software Quality Guidelines and Attributes\\nThroughout the design process, the quality of the evolving design is assessed with a\\nseries of technical reviews discussed in Chapter 15. McGlaughlin [McG91] suggests\\nthree characteristics that serve as a guide for the evaluation of a good design:\\n• The design must implement all of the explicit requirements contained in the\\nrequirements model, and it must accommodate all of the implicit require-\\nments desired by stakeholders.\\n• The design must be a readable, understandable guide for those who generate\\ncode and for those who test and subsequently support the software.\\n• The design should provide a complete picture of the software, addressing the\\ndata, functional, and behavioral domains from an implementation perspective.\\nEach of these characteristics is actually a goal of the design process. But how is each\\nof these goals achieved?\\nQuality Guidelines. In order to evaluate the quality of a design representation,\\nyou and other members of the software team must establish technical criteria for\\ngood design. In Section 8.3, I discuss design concepts that also serve as software\\nquality criteria. For the time being, consider the following guidelines:\\n1. A design should exhibit an architecture that (1) has been created using rec-\\nognizable architectural styles or patterns, (2) is composed of components\\nthat exhibit good design characteristics (these are discussed later in this\\nchapter), and (3) can be implemented in an evolutionary fashion,\\n2 thereby\\nfacilitating implementation and testing.\\n2. A design should be modular; that is, the software should be logically parti-\\ntioned into elements or subsystems.\\n3. A design should contain distinct representations of data, architecture,\\ninterfaces, and components.\\nCHAPTER 8 DESIGN CONCEPTS 219\\nuote:\\n“. . . writing a\\nclever piece of code\\nthat works is one\\nthing; designing\\nsomething that can\\nsupport a long-\\nlasting business is\\nquite another.”\\nC.

They are achieved through the\\napplication of fundamental design principles, systematic methodology, and thorough\\nreview.\\n220 PART TWO MODELING\\nDesign is important because it allows a\\nsoftware team to assess the quality3 of the\\nsoftware before it is implemented—at a time when errors,\\nomissions, or inconsistencies are easy and inexpensive to\\ncorrect. But how do we assess quality during design? The\\nsoftware can’t be tested, because there is no executable\\nsoftware to test. What to do?\\nDuring design, quality is assessed by conducting a series\\nof technical reviews (TRs). TRs are discussed in detail in\\nChapter 15,\\n4 but it’s worth providing a summary of the\\ntechnique at this point. A technical review is a meeting\\nconducted by members of the software team. Usually two,\\nthree, or four people participate depending on the scope of\\nthe design information to be reviewed. Each person plays\\na role: thereview leaderplans the meeting, sets an agenda,\\nand runs the meeting; therecorder takes notes so that\\nnothing is missed; theproducer is the person whose work\\nproduct (e.g., the design of a software component) is being\\nreviewed. Prior to the meeting, each person on the review\\nteam is given a copy of the design work product and is asked\\nto read it, looking for errors, omissions, or ambiguity. When\\nthe meeting commences, the intent is to note all problems\\nwith the work product so that they can be corrected before\\nimplementation begins. The TR typically lasts between 90\\nminutes and 2 hours. At the conclusion of the TR, the review\\nteam determines whether further actions are required on the\\npart of the producer before the design work product can be\\napproved as part of the final design model.\\nINFO\\n3 The quality factors discussed in Chapter 23 can assist the review team as it assesses quality.\\n4 You might consider reviewing Chapter 15 at this time. Technical reviews are a critical part of the\\ndesign process and are an important mechanism for achieving design quality.\\nQuality Attributes. Hewlett-Packard [Gra87] developed a set of software quality\\nattributes that has been given the acronym FURPS—functionality, usability, reliabil-\\nity, performance, and supportability. The FURPS quality attributes represent a target\\nfor all software design:\\n• Functionality is assessed by evaluating the feature set and capabilities of the\\nprogram, the generality of the functions that are delivered, and the security of\\nthe overall system.\\nuote:\\n“Quality isn’t\\nsomething you lay\\non top of subjects\\nand objects like\\ntinsel on a\\nChristmas tree.”\\nRobert Pirsig\\nAssessing Design Quality—The Technical Review\\npre75977_ch08.qxd  11/27/08  3:38 PM  Page 220'),\n",

Early design work concentrated on criteria for the development of\\nmodular programs [Den73] and methods for refining software structures in a top-\\ndown manner [Wir71]. Procedural aspects of design definition evolved into a philos-\\nophy called structured programming [Dah72], [Mil72]. Later work proposed methods\\nfor the translation of data flow [Ste74] or data structure (e.g., [Jac75], [War74]) into\\na design definition. Newer design approaches (e.g., [Jac92], [Gam95]) proposed an\\nobject-oriented approach to design derivation. More recent emphasis in software de-\\nsign has been on software architecture [Kru06] and the design patterns that can be\\nused to implement software architectures and lower levels of design abstractions\\n(e.g., [Hol06] [Sha05]). Growing emphasis on aspect-oriented methods (e.g., [Cla05],\\n[Jac04]), model-driven development [Sch06], and test-driven development [Ast04]\\nemphasize techniques for achieving more effective modularity and architectural\\nstructure in the designs that are created.\\nA number of design methods, growing out of the work just noted, are being ap-\\nplied throughout the industry. Like the analysis methods presented in Chapters 6 and\\n7, each software design method introduces unique heuristics and notation, as well\\nas a somewhat parochial view of what characterizes design quality.

Each\\nhelps you answer the following questions:\\n• What criteria can be used to partition software into individual components?\\n• How is function or data structure detail separated from a conceptual repre-\\nsentation of the software?\\n• What uniform criteria define the technical quality of a software design?\\nM.

At the highest level of abstraction, a solution is stated in broad terms\\nusing the language of the problem environment. At lower levels of abstraction, a\\nmore detailed description of the solution is provided. Problem-oriented terminology\\nis coupled with implementation-oriented terminology in an effort to state a solution.\\nFinally, at the lowest level of abstraction, the solution is stated in a manner that can\\nbe directly implemented.\\nAs different levels of abstraction are developed, you work to create both proce-\\ndural and data abstractions. A procedural abstraction refers to a sequence of instruc-\\ntions that have a specific and limited function. The name of a procedural abstraction\\nimplies these functions, but specific details are suppressed. An example of a proce-\\ndural abstraction would be the word open for a door. Open implies a long sequence\\nof procedural steps (e.g., walk to the door, reach out and grasp knob, turn knob and\\npull door, step away from moving door, etc.).\\n5\\nA data abstraction is a named collection of data that describes a data object. In\\nthe context of the procedural abstraction open, we can define a data abstraction\\ncalled door. Like any data object, the data abstraction for door would encompass\\na set of attributes that describe the door (e.g., door type, swing direction, opening\\nmechanism, weight, dimensions). It follows that the procedural abstraction open\\nwould make use of information contained in the attributes of the data abstraction\\ndoor.\\n8.3.2 Architecture\\nSoftware architecture alludes to “the overall structure of the software and the ways\\nin which that structure provides conceptual integrity for a system” [Sha95a]. In its\\nsimplest form, architecture is the structure or organization of program components\\n(modules), the manner in which these components interact, and the structure of data\\nthat are used by the components. In a broader sense, however, components can be\\ngeneralized to represent major system elements and their interactions.\\nOne goal of software design is to derive an architectural rendering of a system.\\nThis rendering serves as a framework from which more detailed design activities are\\nconducted. A set of architectural patterns enables a software engineer to solve\\ncommon design problems.\\nCHAPTER 8 DESIGN CONCEPTS 223\\nuote:\\n“Abstraction is one\\nof the fundamental\\nways that we as\\nhumans cope with\\ncomplexity.”\\nGrady Booch\\n5 It should be noted, however, that one set of operations can be replaced with another, as long as the\\nfunction implied by the procedural abstraction remains the same. Therefore, the steps required to\\nimplement open would change dramatically if the door were automatic and attached to a sensor.\\nAs a designer, work\\nhard to derive both\\nprocedural and data\\nabstractions that serve\\nthe problem at hand.\\nIf they can serve an\\nentire domain of\\nproblems, that’s even\\nbetter.\\nWebRef\\nAn in-depth discussion\\nof software architecture\\ncan be found at\\nwww.sei.cmu.edu/\\nata/ata_init.html.\\npre75977_ch08.qxd  11/27/08  3:38 PM  Page 223'),\n",

For example, objects are\\npackaged to encapsulate both data and the processing that manipulates the data and in-\\nteract via the invocation of methods.\\nExtra-functional properties. The architectural design description should address\\nhow the design architecture achieves requirements for performance, capacity, reliability,\\nsecurity, adaptability, and other system characteristics.\\nFamilies of related systems.The architectural design should draw upon repeatable\\npatterns that are commonly encountered in the design of families of similar systems. In\\nessence, the design should have the ability to reuse architectural building blocks.\\nGiven the specification of these properties, the architectural design can be repre-\\nsented using one or more of a number of different models [Gar95]. Structural models\\nrepresent architecture as an organized collection of program components.\\nFramework models increase the level of design abstraction by attempting to identify\\nrepeatable architectural design frameworks that are encountered in similar types of\\napplications. Dynamic models address the behavioral aspects of the program archi-\\ntecture, indicating how the structure or system configuration may change as a func-\\ntion of external events. Process models focus on the design of the business or\\ntechnical process that the system must accommodate. Finally, functional models can\\nbe used to represent the functional hierarchy of a system.\\nA number of different architectural description languages (ADLs) have been devel-\\noped to represent these models [Sha95b]. Although many different ADLs have been\\nproposed, the majority provide mechanisms for describing system components and\\nthe manner in which they are connected to one another.\\nYou should note that there is some debate about the role of architecture in design.\\nSome researchers argue that the derivation of software architecture should be sep-\\narated from design and occurs between requirements engineering actions and more\\nconventional design actions. Others believe that the derivation of architecture is an\\nintegral part of the design process. The manner in which software architecture is\\ncharacterized and its role in design are discussed in Chapter 9.\\n8.3.3 Patterns\\nBrad Appleton defines a design pattern in the following manner: “A pattern is a\\nnamed nugget of insight which conveys the essence of a proven solution to a recur-\\nring problem within a certain context amidst competing concerns” [App00].

Design patterns are discussed in detail in Chapter 12.\\n8.3.4 Separation of Concerns\\nSeparation of concerns is a design concept [Dij82] that suggests that any complex\\nproblem can be more easily handled if it is subdivided into pieces that can each be\\nsolved and/or optimized independently. A concern is a feature or behavior that is\\nspecified as part of the requirements model for the software. By separating concerns\\ninto smaller, and therefore more manageable pieces, a problem takes less effort and\\ntime to solve.\\nFor two problems, p\\n1 and p2, if the perceived complexity of p1 is greater than the\\nperceived complexity of p 2, it follows that the effort required to solve p 1 is greater\\nthan the effort required to solve p 2. As a general case, this result is intuitively obvi-\\nous. It does take more time to solve a difficult problem.\\nIt also follows that the perceived complexity of two problems when they are com-\\nbined is often greater than the sum of the perceived complexity when each is taken\\nseparately. This leads to a divide-and-conquer strategy—it’s easier to solve a com-\\nplex problem when you break it into manageable pieces. This has important impli-\\ncations with regard to software modularity.\\nSeparation of concerns is manifested in other related design concepts: modular-\\nity, aspects, functional independence, and refinement. Each will be discussed in the\\nsubsections that follow.\\n8.3.5 Modularity\\nModularity is the most common manifestation of separation of concerns. Software\\nis divided into separately named and addressable components, sometimes called\\nmodules, that are integrated to satisfy problem requirements.\\nIt has been stated that “modularity is the single attribute of software that allows a\\nprogram to be intellectually manageable” [Mye78]. Monolithic software (i.e., a large\\nprogram composed of a single module) cannot be easily grasped by a software engi-\\nneer. The number of control paths, span of reference, number of variables, and over-\\nall complexity would make understanding close to impossible. In almost all\\ninstances, you should break the design into many modules, hoping to make under-\\nstanding easier and, as a consequence, reduce the cost required to build the software.\\nRecalling my discussion of separation of concerns, it is possible to conclude that\\nif you subdivide software indefinitely the effort required to develop it will become\\nnegligibly small! Unfortunately, other forces come into play, causing this conclusion\\nto be (sadly) invalid. Referring to Figure 8.2, the effort (cost) to develop an individual\\nsoftware module does decrease as the total number of modules increases. Given the\\nCHAPTER 8 DESIGN CONCEPTS 225\\nThe argument for sepa-\\nration of concerns can\\nbe taken too far. If\\nyou divide a problem\\ninto an inordinate\\nnumber of very\\nsmall problems,\\nsolving each will be\\neasy, but putting the\\nsolution together—\\nintegration—\\nmay be very difficult.\\npre75977_ch08.qxd  11/27/08  3:38 PM  Page 225'),\n",

However, as\\nthe number of modules grows, the effort (cost) associated with integrating the mod-\\nules also grows. These characteristics lead to a total cost or effort curve shown in the\\nfigure. There is a number, M,of modules that would result in minimum development\\ncost, but we do not have the necessary sophistication to predict M with assurance.\\nThe curves shown in Figure 8.2 do provide useful qualitative guidance when mod-\\nularity is considered. You should modularize, but care should be taken to stay in the\\nvicinity of M.Undermodularity or overmodularity should be avoided. But how do you\\nknow the vicinity of M? How modular should you make software? The answers to\\nthese questions require an understanding of other design concepts considered later\\nin this chapter.\\nYou modularize a design (and the resulting program) so that development can be\\nmore easily planned; software increments can be defined and delivered; changes can\\nbe more easily accommodated; testing and debugging can be conducted more effi-\\nciently, and long-term maintenance can be conducted without serious side effects.\\n8.3.6 Information Hiding\\nThe concept of modularity leads you to a fundamental question: “How do I decom-\\npose a software solution to obtain the best set of modules?” The principle of infor-\\nmation hiding [Par72] suggests that modules be “characterized by design decisions\\nthat (each) hides from all others.” In other words, modules should be specified and\\ndesigned so that information (algorithms and data) contained within a module is in-\\naccessible to other modules that have no need for such information.\\nHiding implies that effective modularity can be achieved by defining a set of inde-\\npendent modules that communicate with one another only that information neces-\\nsary to achieve software function. Abstraction helps to define the procedural (or\\ninformational) entities that make up the software. Hiding defines and enforces access\\nconstraints to both procedural detail within a module and any local data structure\\nused by the module [Ros75].\\n226 PART TWO MODELING\\nM\\nRegion of minimum\\ncost\\nNumber of modules\\nCost or effort\\nCost/module\\nCost to integrate\\nTotal software cost\\nFIGURE 8.2\\nModularity\\nand software\\ncost\\nWhat is the\\nright number\\nof modules for a\\ngiven system?\\n?\\nThe intent of information\\nhiding is to hide the\\ndetails of data structures\\nand procedural processing\\nbehind a module inter-\\nface.

Because most data and procedural detail are hidden from\\nother parts of the software, inadvertent errors introduced during modification are\\nless likely to propagate to other locations within the software.\\n8.3.7 Functional Independence\\nThe concept of functional independence is a direct outgrowth of separation of con-\\ncerns, modularity, and the concepts of abstraction and information hiding. In land-\\nmark papers on software design, Wirth [Wir71] and Parnas [Par72] allude to\\nrefinement techniques that enhance module independence. Later work by Stevens,\\nMyers, and Constantine [Ste74] solidified the concept.\\nFunctional independence is achieved by developing modules with “single-\\nminded” function and an “aversion” to excessive interaction with other modules.\\nStated another way, you should design software so that each module addresses a\\nspecific subset of requirements and has a simple interface when viewed from other\\nparts of the program structure. It is fair to ask why independence is important.\\nSoftware with effective modularity, that is, independent modules, is easier to de-\\nvelop because function can be compartmentalized and interfaces are simplified\\n(consider the ramifications when development is conducted by a team). Independent\\nmodules are easier to maintain (and test) because secondary effects caused by de-\\nsign or code modification are limited, error propagation is reduced, and reusable\\nmodules are possible. To summarize, functional independence is a key to good de-\\nsign, and design is the key to software quality.\\nIndependence is assessed using two qualitative criteria: cohesion and coupling.\\nCohesion is an indication of the relative functional strength of a module. Coupling is\\nan indication of the relative interdependence among modules.\\nCohesion is a natural extension of the information-hiding concept described in\\nSection 8.3.6. A cohesive module performs a single task, requiring little interaction\\nwith other components in other parts of a program. Stated simply, a cohesive mod-\\nule should (ideally) do just one thing. Although you should always strive for high co-\\nhesion (i.e., single-mindedness), it is often necessary and advisable to have a\\nsoftware component perform multiple functions. However, “schizophrenic” compo-\\nnents (modules that perform many unrelated functions) are to be avoided if a good\\ndesign is to be achieved.\\nCoupling is an indication of interconnection among modules in a software struc-\\nture. Coupling depends on the interface complexity between modules, the point at\\nwhich entry or reference is made to a module, and what data pass across the inter-\\nface. In software design, you should strive for the lowest possible coupling. Simple\\nconnectivity among modules results in software that is easier to understand and less\\nprone to a “ripple effect” [Ste74], caused when errors occur at one location and prop-\\nagate throughout a system.\\nCHAPTER 8 DESIGN CONCEPTS 227\\nWhy should\\nyou strive\\nto create\\nindependent\\nmodules?\\n?\\nCohesion is a\\nqualitative indication\\nof the degree to which\\na module focuses on\\njust one thing.\\nCoupling is a\\nqualitative indication of\\nthe degree to which a\\nmodule is connected to\\nother modules and to\\nthe outside world.\\npre75977_ch08.qxd  11/27/08  3:38 PM  Page 227'),\n",

A program is developed by successively refining levels of procedural\\ndetail. A hierarchy is developed by decomposing a macroscopic statement of func-\\ntion (a procedural abstraction) in a stepwise fashion until programming language\\nstatements are reached.\\nRefinement is actually a process of elaboration. You begin with a statement of\\nfunction (or description of information) that is defined at a high level of abstraction.\\nThat is, the statement describes function or information conceptually but provides\\nno information about the internal workings of the function or the internal structure\\nof the information. You then elaborate on the original statement, providing more and\\nmore detail as each successive refinement (elaboration) occurs.\\nAbstraction and refinement are complementary concepts. Abstraction enables\\nyou to specify procedure and data internally but suppress the need for “outsiders” to\\nhave knowledge of low-level details. Refinement helps you to reveal low-level de-\\ntails as design progresses. Both concepts allow you to create a complete design\\nmodel as the design evolves.\\n8.3.9 Aspects\\nAs requirements analysis occurs, a set of “concerns” is uncovered. These concerns\\n“include requirements, use cases, features, data structures, quality-of-service issues,\\nvariants, intellectual property boundaries, collaborations, patterns and contracts”\\n[AOS07]. Ideally, a requirements model can be organized in a way that allows you to\\nisolate each concern (requirement) so that it can be considered independently. In\\npractice, however, some of these concerns span the entire system and cannot be\\neasily compartmentalized.\\nAs design begins, requirements are refined into a modular design representation.\\nConsider two requirements, A and B. Requirement A crosscuts requirement B “if a\\nsoftware decomposition [refinement] has been chosen in which B cannot be satis-\\nfied without taking A into account” [Ros04].\\nFor example, consider two requirements for the SafeHomeAssured.comWebApp.\\nRequirement A is described via the ACS-DCV use case discussed in Chapter 6. A\\ndesign refinement would focus on those modules that would enable a registered user\\nto access video from cameras placed throughout a space. Requirement Bis a generic\\nsecurity requirement that states that a registered user must be validated prior to using\\nSafeHomeAssured.com. This requirement is applicable for all functions that are\\navailable to registered SafeHome users. As design refinement occurs, A* is a design\\nrepresentation for requirement Aand B* is a design representation for requirement B.\\nTherefore, A*and B* are representations of concerns, and B* crosscuts A*.\\nAn aspect is a representation of a crosscutting concern.

To accomplish this, the design ar-\\nchitecture should support a mechanism for defining an aspect—a module that en-\\nables the concern to be implemented across all other concerns that it crosscuts.\\n8.3.10 Refactoring\\nAn important design activity suggested for many agile methods (Chapter 3),\\nrefactoring is a reorganization technique that simplifies the design (or code) of a\\ncomponent without changing its function or behavior. Fowler [Fow00] defines refac-\\ntoring in the following manner: “Refactoring is the process of changing a software\\nsystem in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code [design]\\nyet improves its internal structure.”\\nWhen software is refactored, the existing design is examined for redundancy, un-\\nused design elements, inefficient or unnecessary algorithms, poorly constructed or\\ninappropriate data structures, or any other design failure that can be corrected to yield\\na better design. For example, a first design iteration might yield a component that\\nexhibits low cohesion (i.e., it performs three functions that have only limited relation-\\nship to one another). After careful consideration, you may decide that the component\\nshould be refactored into three separate components, each exhibiting high cohesion.\\nCHAPTER 8 DESIGN CONCEPTS 229\\nWebRef\\nExcellent resources for\\nrefactoring can be\\nfound at www\\n.refactoring.com.\\nWebRef\\nA variety of refactoring\\npatterns can be found at\\nhttp:/ /c2.com/cgi/\\nwiki?Refactoring\\nPatterns.\\nDesign Concepts\\nThe scene: Vinod’s cubicle, as\\ndesign modeling begins.\\nThe players: Vinod, Jamie, and Ed—members of the\\nSafeHome software engineering team.

Each describes\\nsome element of the problem domain, focusing on aspects of the problem that are\\nuser visible. The level of abstraction of an analysis class is relatively high.\\nAs the design model evolves, you will define a set of design classesthat refine the\\nanalysis classes by providing design detail that will enable the classes to be imple-\\nmented, and implement a software infrastructure that supports the business solu-\\ntion. Five different types of design classes, each representing a different layer of the\\ndesign architecture, can be developed [Amb01]:\\n• User interface classes define all abstractions that are necessary for human-\\ncomputer interaction (HCI). In many cases, HCI occurs within the context of \\na metaphor (e.g., a checkbook, an order form, a fax machine), and the design\\nclasses for the interface may be visual representations of the elements of the\\nmetaphor.\\n• Business domain classes are often refinements of the analysis classes defined\\nearlier. The classes identify the attributes and services (methods) that are\\nrequired to implement some element of the business domain.\\n• Process classes implement lower-level business abstractions required to fully\\nmanage the business domain classes.\\n• Persistent classes represent data stores (e.g., a database) that will persist\\nbeyond the execution of the software.\\n• System classes implement software management and control functions that\\nenable the system to operate and communicate within its computing envi-\\nronment and with the outside world.\\n230 PART TWO MODELING\\nShakira: That’s used in Extreme Programming, I think\\nshe said.\\nEd: Yep.

That is, analysis classes represent data\\nobjects (and associated services that are applied to them) using the jargon of the\\nbusiness domain. Design classes present significantly more technical detail as a\\nguide for implementation.\\nArlow and Neustadt [Arl02] suggest that each design class be reviewed to ensure\\nthat it is “well-formed.” They define four characteristics of a well-formed design\\nclass:\\nComplete and sufficient. A design class should be the complete encapsu-\\nlation of all attributes and methods that can reasonably be expected (based\\non a knowledgeable interpretation of the class name) to exist for the class.\\nFor example, the class Scene defined for video-editing software is complete\\nonly if it contains all attributes and methods that can reasonably be associ-\\nated with the creation of a video scene. Sufficiency ensures that the design\\nclass contains only those methods that are sufficient to achieve the intent of\\nthe class, no more and no less.\\nPrimitiveness. Methods associated with a design class should be focused\\non accomplishing one service for the class. Once the service has been imple-\\nmented with a method, the class should not provide another way to accom-\\nplish the same thing. For example, the class VideoClip for video-editing\\nsoftware might have attributes start-point and end-point to indicate the start\\nand end points of the clip (note that the raw video loaded into the system\\nmay be longer than the clip that is used). The methods, setStartPoint() and\\nsetEndPoint(), provide the only means for establishing start and end points\\nfor the clip.\\nHigh cohesion. A cohesive design class has a small, focused set of responsi-\\nbilities and single-mindedly applies attributes and methods to implement\\nthose responsibilities. For example, the classVideoClip might contain a set of\\nmethods for editing the video clip. As long as each method focuses solely on\\nattributes associated with the video clip, cohesion is maintained.\\nLow coupling. Within the design model, it is necessary for design classes to\\ncollaborate with one another. However, collaboration should be kept to an\\nacceptable minimum. If a design model is highly coupled (all design classes\\ncollaborate with all other design classes), the system is difficult to implement,\\nto test, and to maintain over time. In general, design classes within a subsys-\\ntem should have only limited knowledge of other classes. This restriction,\\ncalled the Law of Demeter [Lie03], suggests that a method should only send\\nmessages to methods in neighboring classes.\\n6\\nCHAPTER 8 DESIGN CONCEPTS 231\\nWhat is a\\n“well-\\nformed” design\\nclass?\\n?\\n6 A less formal way of stating the Law of Demeter is “Each unit should only talk to its friends; Don’t\\ntalk to strangers.”\\npre75977_ch08.qxd  11/27/08  3:38 PM  Page 231'),\n",

These pat-\\nterns enable you to apply design knowledge to domain-specific problems that have\\nbeen encountered and solved by others.\\n8.4.1 Data Design Elements\\nLike other software engineering activities, data design (sometimes referred to as data\\narchitecting) creates a model of data and/or information that is represented at a high\\nlevel of abstraction (the customer/user’s view of data). This data model is then re-\\nfined into progressively more implementation-specific representations that can be\\nprocessed by the computer-based system. In many software applications, the archi-\\ntecture of the data will have a profound influence on the architecture of the software\\nthat must process it.\\nThe structure of data has always been an important part of software design. At\\nthe program component level, the design of data structures and the associated\\nalgorithms required to manipulate them is essential to the creation of high-quality\\napplications. At the application level, the translation of a data model (derived as part\\nof requirements engineering) into a database is pivotal to achieving the business\\nobjectives of a system. At the business level, the collection of information stored in\\ndisparate databases and reorganized into a “data warehouse” enables data mining\\nor knowledge discovery that can have an impact on the success of the business itself.\\nIn every case, data design plays an important role. Data design is discussed in more\\ndetail in Chapter 9.\\n8.4.2 Architectural Design Elements\\nThe architectural designfor software is the equivalent to the floor plan of a house. The\\nfloor plan depicts the overall layout of the rooms; their size, shape, and relationship\\nto one another; and the doors and windows that allow movement into and out of the\\nrooms. The floor plan gives us an overall view of the house. Architectural design el-\\nements give us an overall view of the software.\\nThe architectural model [Sha96] is derived from three sources: (1) information\\nabout the application domain for the software to be built; (2) specific requirements\\nmodel elements such as data flow diagrams or analysis classes, their relationships\\nand collaborations for the problem at hand; and (3) the availability of architectural\\nstyles (Chapter 9) and patterns (Chapter 12).\\nThe architectural design element is usually depicted as a set of interconnected\\nsubsystems, often derived from analysis packages within the requirements model.\\nEach subsystem may have it’s own architecture (e.g., a graphical user interface might\\n234 PART TWO MODELING\\nuote:\\n“Questions about\\nwhether design\\nis necessary or\\naffordable are\\nquite beside the\\npoint: design is\\ninevitable.

Tech-\\nniques for deriving specific elements of the architectural model are presented in\\nChapter 9.\\n8.4.3 Interface Design Elements\\nThe interface design for software is analogous to a set of detailed drawings (and\\nspecifications) for the doors, windows, and external utilities of a house. These\\ndrawings depict the size and shape of doors and windows, the manner in which they\\noperate, the way in which utility connections (e.g., water, electrical, gas, telephone)\\ncome into the house and are distributed among the rooms depicted in the floor plan.\\nThey tell us where the doorbell is located, whether an intercom is to be used to an-\\nnounce a visitor’s presence, and how a security system is to be installed. In essence,\\nthe detailed drawings (and specifications) for the doors, windows, and external util-\\nities tell us how things and information flow into and out of the house and within the\\nrooms that are part of the floor plan. The interface design elements for software de-\\npict information flows into and out of the system and how it is communicated among\\nthe components defined as part of the architecture.\\nThere are three important elements of interface design: (1) the user interface (UI);\\n(2) external interfaces to other systems, devices, networks, or other producers or\\nconsumers of information; and (3) internal interfaces between various design com-\\nponents. These interface design elements allow the software to communicate exter-\\nnally and enable internal communication and collaboration among the components\\nthat populate the software architecture.\\nUI design (increasingly called usability design) is a major software engineering ac-\\ntion and is considered in detail in Chapter 11. Usability design incorporates aesthetic\\nelements (e.g., layout, color, graphics, interaction mechanisms), ergonomic ele-\\nments (e.g., information layout and placement, metaphors, UI navigation), and tech-\\nnical elements (e.g., UI patterns, reusable components). In general, the UI is a unique\\nsubsystem within the overall application architecture.\\nThe design of external interfaces requires definitive information about the entity\\nto which information is sent or received. In every case, this information should be\\ncollected during requirements engineering (Chapter 5) and verified once the inter-\\nface design commences.\\n8 The design of external interfaces should incorporate error\\nchecking and (when necessary) appropriate security features.\\nThe design of internal interfaces is closely aligned with component-level design\\n(Chapter 10). Design realizations of analysis classes represent all operations and the\\nmessaging schemes required to enable communication and collaboration between\\noperations in various classes. Each message must be designed to accommodate\\nthe requisite information transfer and the specific functional requirements of the\\nCHAPTER 8 DESIGN CONCEPTS 235\\nuote:\\n“The public is more\\nfamiliar with bad\\ndesign than good\\ndesign.

If the classic input-process-output approach to\\ndesign is chosen, the interface of each software component is designed based on data\\nflow representations and the functionality described in a processing narrative.\\nIn some cases, an interface is modeled in much the same way as a class. In UML,\\nan interface is defined in the following manner [OMG03a]: “An interface is a speci-\\nfier for the externally-visible [public] operations of a class, component, or other clas-\\nsifier (including subsystems) without specification of internal structure.” Stated more\\nsimply, an interface is a set of operations that describes some part of the behavior of\\na class and provides access to these operations.\\nFor example, the SafeHomesecurity function makes use of a control panel that al-\\nlows a homeowner to control certain aspects of the security function. In an advanced\\nversion of the system, control panel functions may be implemented via a wireless\\nPDA or mobile phone.\\nThe ControlPanel class (Figure 8.5) provides the behavior associated with a key-\\npad, and therefore, it must implement the operations readKeyStroke ()and decodeKey ().\\nIf these operations are to be provided to other classes (in this case, WirelessPDA\\nand MobilePhone), it is useful to define an interface as shown in the figure. The\\ninterface, named KeyPad, is shown as an <<interface>> stereotype or as a small,\\nlabeled circle connected to the class with a line. The interface is defined with no\\nattributes and the set of operations that are necessary to achieve the behavior of\\na keypad.\\nThe dashed line with an open triangle at its end (Figure 8.5) indicates that the\\nControlPanel class provides KeyPadoperations as part of its behavior.

These drawings depict wiring and\\nplumbing within each room, the location of electrical receptacles and wall switches,\\nfaucets, sinks, showers, tubs, drains, cabinets, and closets. They also describe the\\nflooring to be used, the moldings to be applied, and every other detail associated\\nwith a room. The component-level design for software fully describes the internal\\ndetail of each software component. To accomplish this, the component-level design\\ndefines data structures for all local data objects and algorithmic detail for all pro-\\ncessing that occurs within a component and an interface that allows access to all\\ncomponent operations (behaviors).\\nWithin the context of object-oriented software engineering, a component is rep-\\nresented in UML diagrammatic form as shown in Figure 8.6. In this figure, a compo-\\nnent named SensorManagement (part of the SafeHome security function) is\\nrepresented. A dashed arrow connects the component to a class named Sensor that\\nis assigned to it. The SensorManagementcomponent performs all functions asso-\\nciated with SafeHome sensors including monitoring and configuring them. Further\\ndiscussion of component diagrams is presented in Chapter 10.\\nThe design details of a component can be modeled at many different levels of\\nabstraction. A UML activity diagram can be used to represent processing logic.\\nDetailed procedural flow for a component can be represented using either\\npseudocode (a programming language-like representation described in Chapter 10)\\nor some other diagrammatic form (e.g., flowchart or box diagram). Algorithmic\\nstructure follows the rules established for structured programming (i.e., a set of con-\\nstrained procedural constructs). Data structures, selected based on the nature of the\\ndata objects to be processed, are usually modeled using pseudocode or the pro-\\ngramming language to be used for implementation.\\n8.4.5 Deployment-Level Design Elements\\nDeployment-level design elements indicate how software functionality and subsys-\\ntems will be allocated within the physical computing environment that will support\\nCHAPTER 8 DESIGN CONCEPTS 237\\nuote:\\n“The details are\\nnot the details.\\nThey make the\\ndesign.”\\nCharles Eames\\nSensorManagement Sensor\\nFIGURE 8.6\\nA UML\\ncomponent\\ndiagram\\npre75977_ch08.qxd  11/27/08  3:39 PM  Page 237'),\n",

The intent of software design is to apply a set of principles,\\nconcepts, and practices that lead to the development of a high-quality system or\\nproduct. The goal of design is to create a model of software that will implement all\\ncustomer requirements correctly and bring delight to those who use it. Software de-\\nsigners must sift through many design alternatives and converge on a solution that\\nbest suits the needs of project stakeholders.\\nThe design process moves from a “big picture” view of software to a more narrow\\nview that defines the detail required to implement a system. The process begins by\\nfocusing on architecture. Subsystems are defined; communication mechanisms\\namong subsystems are established; components are identified, and a detailed de-\\nscription of each component is developed. In addition, external, internal, and user\\ninterfaces are designed.\\nDesign concepts have evolved over the first 60 years of software engineering\\nwork. They describe attributes of computer software that should be present regard-\\nless of the software engineering process that is chosen, the design methods that are\\napplied, or the programming languages that are used. In essence, design concepts\\nemphasize the need for abstraction as a mechanism for creating reusable software\\ncomponents; the importance of architecture as a way to better understand the over-\\nall structure of a system; the benefits of pattern-based engineering as a technique for\\ndesigning software with proven capabilities; the value of separation of concerns and\\neffective modularity as a way to make software more understandable, more testable,\\nand more maintainable; the consequences of information hiding as a mechanism\\nfor reducing the propagation of side effects when errors do occur; the impact of\\nfunctional independence as a criterion for building effective modules; the use of\\nrefinement as a design mechanism; a consideration of aspects that crosscut system\\nrequirements; the application of refactoring for optimizing the design that is derived;\\nand the importance of object-oriented classes and the characteristics that are related\\nto them.\\nThe design model encompasses four different elements. As each of these ele-\\nments is developed, a more complete view of the design evolves. The architectural\\nelement uses information derived from the application domain, the requirements\\nmodel, and available catalogs for patterns and styles to derive a complete structural\\nrepresentation of the software, its subsystems, and components. Interface design el-\\nements model external and internal interfaces and the user interface. Component-\\nlevel elements define each of the modules (components) that populate the\\narchitecture. Finally, deployment-level design elements allocate the architecture, its\\ncomponents, and the interfaces to the physical configuration that will house the\\nsoftware.\\nCHAPTER 8 DESIGN CONCEPTS 239\\npre75977_ch08.qxd  11/27/08  3:39 PM  Page 239'),\n",

Historically, architectures have been\\nimplicit—accidents of implementation, or legacy systems of the past.

At the most simplistic level, you think about the overall shape of the physical\\nstructure. But in reality, architecture is much more. It is the manner in which the var-\\nious components of the building are integrated to form a cohesive whole. It is the\\nway in which the building fits into its environment and meshes with other buildings\\nin its vicinity. It is the degree to which the building meets its stated purpose and sat-\\nisfies the needs of its owner. It is the aesthetic feel of the structure—the visual im-\\npact of the building—and the way textures, colors, and materials are combined to\\ncreate the external facade and the internal “living environment.” It is small details—\\nthe design of lighting fixtures, the type of flooring, the placement of wall hangings,\\nthe list is almost endless. And finally, it is art.\\nBut architecture is also something else. It is “thousands of decisions, both big and\\nsmall” [Tyr05].

Bass, Clements, and Kazman [Bas03]\\ndefine this elusive term in the following way:\\nThe software architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures\\nof the system, which comprise software components, the externally visible properties of\\nthose components, and the relationships among them.\\nThe architecture is not the operational software. Rather, it is a representation that\\nenables you to (1) analyze the effectiveness of the design in meeting its stated re-\\nquirements, (2) consider architectural alternatives at a stage when making design\\nchanges is still relatively easy, and (3) reduce the risks associated with the construc-\\ntion of the software.\\nThis definition emphasizes the role of “software components” in any architectural\\nrepresentation. In the context of architectural design, a software component can be\\nsomething as simple as a program module or an object-oriented class, but it can also\\nbe extended to include databases and “middleware” that enable the configuration of\\na network of clients and servers. The properties of components are those character-\\nistics that are necessary for an understanding of how the components interact with\\nother components. At the architectural level, internal properties (e.g., details of an al-\\ngorithm) are not specified. The relationships between components can be as simple\\nas a procedure call from one module to another or as complex as a database access\\nprotocol.\\nSome members of the software engineering community (e.g., [Kaz03]) make a\\ndistinction between the actions associated with the derivation of a software archi-\\ntecture (what I call “architectural design”) and the actions that are applied to derive\\nthe software design. As one reviewer of this edition noted:\\nThere is a distinct difference between the terms architecture and design. A design is an\\ninstance of an architecture similar to an object being an instance of a class. For example,\\nconsider the client-server architecture. I can design a network-centric software system in\\nmany different ways from this architecture using either the Java platform (Java EE) or\\nMicrosoft platform (.NET framework). So, there is one architecture, but many designs can\\nbe created based on that architecture. Therefore, you cannot mix “architecture” and\\n“design” with each other.\\nAlthough I agree that a software design is an instance of a specific software\\narchitecture, the elements and structures that are defined as part of an architec-\\nture are the root of every design that evolves from them. Design begins with a\\nconsideration of architecture.\\nIn this book the design of software architecture considers two levels of the design\\npyramid (Figure 8.1)—data design and architectural design.

Architectural design focuses on the\\nrepresentation of the structure of software components, their properties, and inter-\\nactions.\\n9.1.2 Why Is Architecture Important?\\nIn a book dedicated to software architecture, Bass and his colleagues [Bas03] iden-\\ntify three key reasons that software architecture is important:\\n• Representations of software architecture are an enabler for communication\\nbetween all parties (stakeholders) interested in the development of a\\ncomputer-based system.\\n• The architecture highlights early design decisions that will have a profound\\nimpact on all software engineering work that follows and, as important, on\\nthe ultimate success of the system as an operational entity.\\n• Architecture “constitutes a relatively small, intellectually graspable model of\\nhow the system is structured and how its components work together” [Bas03].\\nThe architectural design model and the architectural patterns contained within it\\nare transferable. That is, architecture genres, styles, and patterns (Sections 9.2\\nthrough 9.4) can be applied to the design of other systems and represent a set of\\nabstractions that enable software engineers to describe architecture in predictable\\nways.\\n9.1.3 Architectural Descriptions\\nEach of us has a mental image of what the word architecturemeans. In reality, how-\\never, it means different things to different people. The implication is that different\\nstakeholders will see an architecture from different viewpoints that are driven by dif-\\nferent sets of concerns. This implies that an architectural description is actually a set\\nof work products that reflect different views of the system.\\nFor example, the architect of a major office building must work with a variety of\\ndifferent stakeholders. The primary concern of the owner of the building (one stake-\\nholder) is to ensure that it is aesthetically pleasing and that it provides sufficient of-\\nfice space and infrastructure to ensure its profitability. Therefore, the architect must\\ndevelop a description using views of the building that address the owner’s concerns.\\nThe viewpoints used are a three-dimensional drawings of the building (to illustrate\\nthe aesthetic view) and a set of two-dimensional floor plans to address this stake-\\nholder’s concern for office space and infrastructure.\\nBut the office building has many other stakeholders, including the structural\\nsteel fabricator who will provide steel for the building skeleton. The structural steel\\nfabricator needs detailed architectural information about the structural steel that will\\nsupport the building, including types of I-beams, their dimensions, connectivity,\\nmaterials, and many other details. These concerns are addressed by different work\\nproducts that represent different views of the architecture.

Tyree and Akerman\\n[Tyr05] note this when they write: “Developers want clear, decisive guidance on how\\nto proceed with design. Customers want a clear understanding on the environmen-\\ntal changes that must occur and assurances that the architecture will meet their busi-\\nness needs. Other architects want a clear, salient understanding of the architecture’s\\nkey aspects.” Each of these “wants” is reflected in a different view represented using\\na different viewpoint.\\nThe IEEE Computer Society has proposed IEEE-Std-1471-2000, Recommended\\nPractice for Architectural Description of Software-Intensive Systems, [IEE00], with the\\nfollowing objectives: (1) to establish a conceptual framework and vocabulary for use\\nduring the design of software architecture, (2) to provide detailed guidelines for rep-\\nresenting an architectural description, and (3) to encourage sound architectural\\ndesign practices.\\nThe IEEE standard defines an architectural description(AD) as “a collection of prod-\\nucts to document an architecture.” The description itself is represented using multiple\\nviews, where each viewis “a representation of a whole system from the perpective of\\na related set of [stakeholder] concerns.” A view is created according to rules and con-\\nventions defined in a viewpoint—“a specification of the conventions for constructing\\nand using a view” [IEE00]. A number of different work products that are used to de-\\nvelop different views of the software architecture are discussed later in this chapter.\\n9.1.4 Architectural Decisions\\nEach view developed as part of an architectural description addresses a specific\\nstakeholder concern. To develop each view (and the architectural description as a\\nwhole) the system architect considers a variety of alternatives and ultimately decides\\non the specific architectural features that best meet the concern. Therefore, archi-\\ntectural decisions themselves can be considered to be one view of the architecture.\\nThe reasons that decisions were made provide insight into the structure of a system\\nand its conformance to stakeholder concerns.\\nAs a system architect, you can use the template suggested in the sidebar to docu-\\nment each major decision.

The builder\\nhas used an architectural style as a descriptive mechanism to differentiate the house\\nfrom other styles (e.g., A-frame, raised ranch, Cape Cod). But more important, the\\narchitectural style is also a template for construction. Further details of the house\\nmust be defined, its final dimensions must be specified, customized features may\\nbe added, building materials are to be determined, but the style—a “center hall\\ncolonial”—guides the builder in his work.\\nThe software that is built for computer-based systems also exhibits one of many\\narchitectural styles. Each style describes a system category that encompasses (1) a\\nset of components (e.g., a database, computational modules) that perform a function\\nrequired by a system; (2) a set of connectors that enable “communication, coordina-\\ntion and cooperation” among components; (3) constraints that define how compo-\\nnents can be integrated to form the system; and (4) semantic models that enable a\\ndesigner to understand the overall properties of a system by analyzing the known\\nproperties of its constituent parts [Bas03].\\nAn architectural style is a transformation that is imposed on the design of an en-\\ntire system. The intent is to establish a structure for all components of the system.\\nIn the case where an existing architecture is to be reengineered (Chapter 29), the\\nimposition of an architectural style will result in fundamental changes to the struc-\\nture of the software including a reassignment of the functionality of components\\n[Bos00].\\nAn architectural pattern, like an architectural style, imposes a transformation on\\nthe design of an architecture. However, a pattern differs from a style in a number of\\nfundamental ways: (1) the scope of a pattern is less broad, focusing on one aspect\\nof the architecture rather than the architecture in its entirety; (2) a pattern imposes a\\nCHAPTER 9 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 249\\nuote:\\n“There is at the\\nback of every\\nartist’s mind, a\\npattern or type of\\narchitecture.”\\nG.

In Section 9.3.1, I consider commonly used architec-\\ntural styles and patterns for software.\\n250 PART TWO MODELING\\nCanonical Architectural Structures\\nIn essence, software architecture represents a\\nstructure in which some collection of entities (often\\ncalled components) is connected by a set of defined\\nrelationships (often called connectors). Both components\\nand connectors are associated with a set of properties that\\nallow the designer to differentiate the types of components\\nand connectors that can be used. But what kinds of\\nstructures (components, connectors, and properties) can be\\nused to describe an architecture? Bass and Kazman\\n[Bas03] suggest five canonical or foundation architectural\\nstructures:\\nFunctional structure. Components represent function\\nor processing entities. Connectors represent interfaces that\\nprovide the ability to “use” or “pass data to” a component.\\nProperties describe the nature of the components and the\\norganization of the interfaces.\\nImplementation structure. “Components can be\\npackages, classes, objects, procedures, functions,\\nmethods, etc., all of which are vehicles for packaging\\nfunctionality at various levels of abstraction” [Bas03].\\nConnectors include the ability to pass data and control,\\nshare data, “use”, and “is-an-instance-of.” Properties\\nfocus on quality characteristics (e.g., maintainability,\\nreusability) that result when the structure is implemented.\\nConcurrency structure. Components represent “units\\nof concurrency” that are organized as parallel tasks or\\nthreads. “Relations [connectors] include synchronizes-with,\\nis-higher-priority-than, sends-data-to, can’t-run-without, and\\ncan’t-run-with. Properties relevant to this structure include\\npriority, preemptability, and execution time” [Bas03].\\nPhysical structure. This structure is similar to the\\ndeployment model developed as part of design. The\\ncomponents are the physical hardware on which software\\nresides. Connectors are the interfaces between hardware\\ncomponents, and properties address capacity, bandwidth,\\nperformance, and other attributes.\\nDevelopmental structure. This structure defines the\\ncomponents, work products, and other information sources\\nthat are required as software engineering proceeds.\\nConnectors represent the relationships among work prod-\\nucts, and properties identify the characteristics of each item.\\nEach of these structures presents a different view of\\nsoftware architecture, exposing information that is useful to\\nthe software team as modeling and construction proceed.\\nINFO\\n9.3.1 A Brief Taxonomy of Architectural Styles\\nAlthough millions of computer-based systems have been created over the past\\n60 years, the vast majority can be categorized into one of a relatively small number\\nof architectural styles:\\nData-centered architectures. A data store (e.g., a file or database) resides at\\nthe center of this architecture and is accessed frequently by other components that\\nupdate, add, delete, or otherwise modify data within the store. Figure 9.1 illus-\\ntrates a typical data-centered style. Client software accesses a central repository.\\nIn some cases the data repository is passive. That is, client software accesses the\\ndata independent of any changes to the data or the actions of other client soft-\\nware. A variation on this approach transforms the repository into a “blackboard”\\nuote:\\n“The use of\\npatterns and styles\\nof design is\\npervasive in\\nengineering\\ndisciplines.”\\nMary Shaw and\\nDavid Garlan\\npre75977_ch09.qxd  11/27/08  3:42 PM  Page 250'),\n",

That is, existing\\ncomponents can be changed and new client components added to the architecture\\nwithout concern about other clients (because the client components operate\\nindependently). In addition, data can be passed among clients using the black-\\nboard mechanism (i.e., the blackboard component serves to coordinate the trans-\\nfer of information between clients). Client components independently execute\\nprocesses.\\nData-flow architectures. This architecture is applied when input data are to be\\ntransformed through a series of computational or manipulative components into\\noutput data. A pipe-and-filter pattern (Figure 9.2) has a set of components, called\\nfilters, connected by pipes that transmit data from one component to the next. Each\\nfilter works independently of those components upstream and downstream, is de-\\nsigned to expect data input of a certain form, and produces data output (to the next\\nfilter) of a specified form. However, the filter does not require knowledge of the\\nworkings of its neighboring filters.\\nIf the data flow degenerates into a single line of transforms, it is termed batch se-\\nquential. This structure accepts a batch of data and then applies a series of sequen-\\ntial components (filters) to transform it.\\nCall and return architectures. This architectural style enables you to achieve a\\nprogram structure that is relatively easy to modify and scale. A number of substyles\\n[Bas03] exist within this category:\\n• Main program/subprogram architectures.

The following questions [Bas03] provide insight\\ninto an architectural style:\\nControl. How is control managed within the architecture? Does a distinct\\ncontrol hierarchy exist, and if so, what is the role of components within this\\ncontrol hierarchy? How do components transfer control within the system?\\nHow is control shared among components? What is the control topology\\n(i.e., the geometric form that the control takes)? Is control synchronized or\\ndo components operate asynchronously?\\nData. How are data communicated between components? Is the flow of data\\ncontinuous, or are data objects passed to the system sporadically? What is the\\nmode of data transfer (i.e., are data passed from one component to another\\nor are data available globally to be shared among system components)? Do\\ndata components (e.g., a blackboard or repository) exist, and if so, what is\\ntheir role? How do functional components interact with data components?\\nAre data components passive or active (i.e., does the data component\\nactively interact with other components in the system)? How do data and\\ncontrol interact within the system?\\nThese questions provide the designer with an early assessment of design quality and\\nlay the foundation for more detailed analysis of the architecture.\\n9.4 A RCHITECTURAL DESIGN\\nAs architectural design begins, the software to be developed must be put into\\ncontext—that is, the design should define the external entities (other systems, de-\\nvices, people) that the software interacts with and the nature of the interaction. This\\ninformation can generally be acquired from the requirements model and all other\\ninformation gathered during requirements engineering. Once context is modeled\\nand all external software interfaces have been described, you can identify a set of\\narchitectural archetypes. An archetype is an abstraction (similar to a class) that rep-\\nresents one element of system behavior. The set of archetypes provides a collection\\nof abstractions that must be modeled architecturally if the system is to be con-\\nstructed, but the archetypes themselves do not provide enough implementation de-\\ntail. Therefore, the designer specifies the structure of the system by defining and\\nrefining software components that implement each archetype. This process contin-\\nues iteratively until a complete architectural structure has been derived. In the\\nsections that follow we examine each of these architectural design tasks in a bit\\nmore detail.\\nHow do I\\nassess an\\narchitectural style\\nthat has been\\nderived?\\n?\\nuote:\\n“A doctor can bury\\nhis mistakes, but\\nan architect can\\nonly advise his\\nclient to plant\\nvines.”\\nFrank Lloyd\\nWright\\npre75977_ch09.qxd  11/27/08  3:42 PM  Page 255'),\n",

All data that flow into and out of the target sys-\\ntem must be identified at this stage.\\n9.4.2 Defining Archetypes\\nAn archetype is a class or pattern that represents a core abstraction that is critical to\\nthe design of an architecture for the target system. In general, a relatively small set\\nof archetypes is required to design even relatively complex systems. The target sys-\\ntem architecture is composed of these archetypes, which represent stable elements\\nof the architecture but may be instantiated many different ways based on the\\nbehavior of the system.\\nIn many cases, archetypes can be derived by examining the analysis classes de-\\nfined as part of the requirements model. Continuing the discussion of the SafeHome\\nhome security function, you might define the following archetypes:\\n• Node. Represents a cohesive collection of input and output elements of\\nthe home security function. For example a node might be comprised of\\n(1) various sensors and (2) a variety of alarm (output) indicators.\\n• Detector. An abstraction that encompasses all sensing equipment that feeds\\ninformation into the target system.\\nCHAPTER 9 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN 257\\nArchetypes are the\\nabstract building blocks\\nof an architectural\\ndesign.\\nTarget system: \\nsecurity function\\nUses \\nUses PeersHomeowner\\nSafeHome\\nproduct\\nInternet-based\\nsystem\\nSurveillance\\nfunction\\nSensors\\nControl \\npanel\\nSensors\\n Uses\\nFIGURE 9.6\\nArchitectural\\ncontext\\ndiagram for\\nthe SafeHome\\nsecurity\\nfunction\\npre75977_ch09.qxd  11/27/08  3:42 PM  Page 257'),\n",

In order to answer this\\nquestion, you begin with the classes that were described as part of the require-\\nments model.\\n4 These analysis classes represent entities within the application\\n(business) domain that must be addressed within the software architecture. Hence,\\nthe application domain is one source for the derivation and refinement of compo-\\nnents. Another source is the infrastructure domain. The architecture must accom-\\nmodate many infrastructure components that enable application components\\nbut have no business connection to the application domain. For example, mem-\\nory management components, communication components, database compo-\\nnents, and task management components are often integrated into the software\\narchitecture.\\n258 PART TWO MODELING\\nController\\nNode\\nCommunicates with\\nDetector Indicator\\nFIGURE 9.7\\nUML relation-\\nships for\\nSafeHome\\nsecurity\\nfunction\\narchetypes\\nSource: Adapted from\\n[Bos00].\\n4 If a conventional (non-object-oriented) approach is chosen, components are derived from the data\\nflow model.

Wouldn’t it\\nbe nice to know in advance if you’ve placed your bet on a winner, as opposed to waiting\\nuntil the system is mostly completed before knowing whether it will meet its requirements\\nor not? If you’re buying a system or paying for its development, wouldn’t you like to have\\nsome assurance that it’s started off down the right path? If you’re the architect yourself,\\nwouldn’t you like to have a good way to validate your intuitions and experience, so that\\nyou can sleep at night knowing that the trust placed in your design is well founded?\\nIndeed, answers to these questions would have value. Design results in a number of\\narchitectural alternatives that are each assessed to determine which is the most\\nappropriate for the problem to be solved. In the sections that follow, I present two\\ndifferent approaches for the assessment of alternative architectural designs. The first\\nmethod uses an iterative method to assess design trade-offs. The second approach\\napplies a pseudo-quantitative technique for assessing design quality.\\npre75977_ch09.qxd  11/27/08  3:42 PM  Page 261'),\n",

The design analysis activities that follow are performed iteratively:\\n1. Collect scenarios. A set of use cases (Chapters 5 and 6) is developed to\\nrepresent the system from the user’s point of view.\\n2. Elicit requirements, constraints, and environment description. This information\\nis determined as part of requirements engineering and is used to be certain\\nthat all stakeholder concerns have been addressed.\\n3. Describe the architectural styles/patterns that have been chosen to address the\\nscenarios and requirements. The architectural style(s) should be described\\nusing one of the following architectural views:\\n• Module view for analysis of work assignments with components and the\\ndegree to which information hiding has been achieved.\\n• Process view for analysis of system performance.\\n• Data flow view for analysis of the degree to which the architecture meets\\nfunctional requirements.\\n4. Evaluate quality attributes by considering each attribute in isolation. The num-\\nber of quality attributes chosen for analysis is a function of the time available\\nfor review and the degree to which quality attributes are relevant to the sys-\\ntem at hand. Quality attributes for architectural design assessment include\\nreliability, performance, security, maintainability, flexibility, testability, porta-\\nbility, reusability, and interoperability.\\n5. Identify the sensitivity of quality attributes to various architectural attributes for a\\nspecific architectural style.This can be accomplished by making small changes in\\nthe architecture and determining how sensitive a quality attribute, say perform-\\nance, is to the change. Any attributes that are significantly affected by variation\\nin the architecture are termed sensitivity points.\\n6. Critique candidate architectures (developed in step 3) using the sensitivity analy-\\nsis conducted in step 5. The SEI describes this approach in the following\\nmanner [Kaz98]:\\nOnce the architectural sensitivity points have been determined, finding trade-off\\npoints is simply the identification of architectural elements to which multiple attrib-\\nutes are sensitive. For example, the performance of a client-server architecture might\\nbe highly sensitive to the number of servers (performance increases, within some\\nrange, by increasing the number of servers). . . . The number of servers, then, is a\\ntrade-off point with respect to this architecture.\\nThese six steps represent the first ATAM iteration. Based on the results of steps 5 and\\n6, some architecture alternatives may be eliminated, one or more of the remaining\\npre75977_ch09.qxd  11/27/08  3:42 PM  Page 262'),\n",

Coupling is an important design concept that is appli-\\ncable at the architectural level and at the component level. Simple metrics for\\nevaluating coupling are discussed in Chapter 23.\\n9.5.3 Architectural Description Languages\\nThe architect of a house has a set of standardized tools and notation that allow the\\ndesign to be represented in an unambiguous, understandable fashion. Although the\\nsoftware architect can draw on UML notation, other diagrammatic forms, and a few\\nrelated tools, there is a need for a more formal approach to the specification of an\\narchitectural design.\\nArchitectural description language(ADL) provides a semantics and syntax for describ-\\ning a software architecture. Hofmann and his colleagues [Hof01] suggest that an ADL\\nshould provide the designer with the ability to decompose architectural components,\\ncompose individual components into larger architectural blocks, and represent inter-\\nfaces (connection mechanisms) between components. Once descriptive, language-\\nbased techniques for architectural design have been established, it is more likely that\\neffective assessment methods for architectures will be established as the design evolves.\\nThe following summary of a number of important\\nADLs was prepared by Rickard Land [Lan02]\\nand is reprinted with the author’s permission. It should be\\nnoted that the first five ADLs listed have been developed for\\nresearch purposes and are not commercial products.\\nRapide (http://poset.stanford.edu/rapide/)\\nbuilds on the notion of partial ordered sets, and thus\\nintroduces quite new (but seemingly powerful)\\nprogramming constructs.\\nUniCon (www.cs.cmu.edu/~UniCon) is “an\\narchitectural description language intended to aid\\ndesigners in defining software architectures in terms of\\nabstractions that they find useful.”\\nAesop (www.cs.cmu.edu/~able/aesop/)\\naddresses the problem of style reuse. With Aesop, it is\\npossible to define styles and use them when constructing\\nan actual system.\\nWright (www.cs.cmu.edu/~able/wright/) is a\\nformal language including the following elements:\\ncomponents with ports, connectors with roles, and glue\\nto attach roles to ports. Architectural styles can be\\nformalized in the language with predicates, thus\\nallowing for static checks to determine the consistency\\nand completeness of an architecture.\\nAcme (www.cs.cmu.edu/~acme/) can be seen as\\na second-generation ADL, in that its intention is to\\nidentify a kind of least common denominator for\\nADLs.\\nUML (www.uml.org/) includes many of the artifacts\\nneeded for architectural descriptions—processes,\\nnodes, views, etc. For informal descriptions, UML is\\nwell suited just because it is a widely understood\\nstandard.

So it should come as no surprise that a comprehensive mapping that\\naccomplishes the transition from the requirements model to a variety of architectural\\nstyles does not exist. In fact, there is no practical mapping for some architectural\\nstyles, and the designer must approach the translation of requirements to design for\\nthese styles in using the techniques discussed in Section 9.4.\\nTo illustrate one approach to architectural mapping, consider the call and return\\narchitecture—an extremely common structure for many types of systems. The call\\nand return architecture can reside within other more sophisticated architectures\\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. For example, the architecture of one or more\\ncomponents of a client-server architecture might be call and return.\\nA mapping technique, called structured design[You79], is often characterized as a\\ndata flow-oriented design method because it provides a convenient transition from a\\ndata flow diagram (Chapter 7) to software architecture.\\n7 The transition from informa-\\ntion flow (represented as a DFD) to program structure is accomplished as part of a six-\\nstep process: (1) the type of information flow is established, (2) flow boundaries are\\nindicated, (3) the DFD is mapped into the program structure, (4) control hierarchy is\\ndefined, (5) the resultant structure is refined using design measures and heuristics, and\\n(6) the architectural description is refined and elaborated.\\nAs a brief example of data flow mapping, I present a step-by-step “transform”\\nmapping for a small part of the SafeHome security function.\\n8 In order to perform the\\nmapping, the type of information flow must be determined. One type of information\\nflow is called transform flow and exhibits a linear quality. Data flows into the system\\nalong an incoming flow path where it is transformed from an external world\\nrepresentation into internalized form. Once it has been internalized, it is processed\\nat a transform center. Finally, it flows out of the system along an outgoing flow path\\nthat transforms the data into external world form.\\n9\\n9.6.1 Transform Mapping\\nTransform mapping is a set of design steps that allows a DFD with transform flow\\ncharacteristics to be mapped into a specific architectural style.

That is, the\\nprocess implied by a transform performs a single, distinct function that can be\\nimplemented as a component in the SafeHome software. Therefore, the DFD in\\nFigure 9.13 contains sufficient detail for a “first cut” at the design of architecture for\\nthe monitor sensors subsystem, and we proceed without further refinement.\\nStep 3. Determine whether the DFD has transform or transaction flow\\n11\\ncharacteristics. Evaluating the DFD (Figure 9.13), we see data entering the soft-\\nware along one incoming path and exiting along three outgoing paths. Therefore, an\\noverall transform characteristic will be assumed for information flow.\\nStep 4. Isolate the transform center by specifying incoming and outgoing\\nflow boundaries. Incoming data flows along a path in which information is\\nconverted from external to internal form; outgoing flow converts internalized data\\nto external form. Incoming and outgoing flow boundaries are open to interpretation.\\nThat is, different designers may select slightly different points in the flow as bound-\\nary locations. In fact, alternative design solutions can be derived by varying the\\nplacement of flow boundaries. Although care should be taken when boundaries are\\nselected, a variance of one bubble along a flow path will generally have little impact\\non the final program structure.\\nFlow boundaries for the example are illustrated as shaded curves running verti-\\ncally through the flow in Figure 9.13. The transforms (bubbles) that constitute the\\ntransform center lie within the two shaded boundaries that run from top to bottom\\nin the figure. An argument can be made to readjust a boundary (e.g., an incoming\\nflow boundary separating read sensorsand acquire response info could be proposed).\\nThe emphasis in this design step should be on selecting reasonable boundaries,\\nrather than lengthy iteration on placement of divisions.\\nStep 5. Perform “first-level factoring.” The program architecture derived using\\nthis mapping results in a top-down distribution of control. Factoring leads to a\\nprogram structure in which top-level components perform decision making and low-\\nlevel components perform most input, computation, and output work. Middle-level\\ncomponents perform some control and do moderate amounts of work.\\nWhen transform flow is encountered, a DFD is mapped to a specific structure\\n(a call and return architecture) that provides control for incoming, transform, and\\noutgoing information processing. This first-level factoring for the monitor sensors\\nsubsystem is illustrated in Figure 9.14. A main controller (called monitor sensors\\nexecutive) resides at the top of the program structure and coordinates the following\\nsubordinate control functions:\\n• An incoming information processing controller, called sensor input controller,\\ncoordinates receipt of all incoming data.\\n268 PART TWO MODELING\\nYou will often\\nencounter both other\\ntypes of data flow\\nwithin the same flow-\\noriented model.

Perform “second-level factoring.” Second-level factoring is accom-\\nplished by mapping individual transforms (bubbles) of a DFD into appropriate\\nmodules within the architecture.

As I discussed earlier in this chapter, alternative architectural styles may\\nbe derived, refined, and evaluated for the “best” approach. This approach to opti-\\nmization is one of the true benefits derived by developing a representation of soft-\\nware architecture.\\nIt is important to note that structural simplicity often reflects both elegance and\\nefficiency. Design refinement should strive for the smallest number of components\\nthat is consistent with effective modularity and the least complex data structure that\\nadequately serves information requirements.\\n9.7 S UMMARY\\nSoftware architecture provides a holistic view of the system to be built. It depicts the\\nstructure and organization of software components, their properties, and the con-\\nnections between them. Software components include program modules and the\\nvarious data representations that are manipulated by the program. Therefore, data\\ndesign is an integral part of the derivation of the software architecture. Architecture\\nhighlights early design decisions and provides a mechanism for considering the ben-\\nefits of alternative system structures.\\nA number of different architectural styles and patterns are available to the soft-\\nware engineer and may be applied within a given architectural genre. Each style de-\\nscribes a system category that encompasses a set of components that perform a\\nfunction required by a system; a set of connectors that enable communication, co-\\nordination, and cooperation among components; constraints that define how com-\\nponents can be integrated to form the system; and semantic models that enable a\\ndesigner to understand the overall properties of a system.\\nIn a general sense, architectural design is accomplished using four distinct steps.\\nFirst, the system must be represented in context. That is, the designer should define\\nthe external entities that the software interacts with and the nature of the interac-\\ntion. Once context has been specified, the designer should identify a set of top-level\\nabstractions, called archetypes, that represent pivotal elements of the system’s be-\\nhavior or function. After abstractions have been defined, the design begins to move\\ncloser to the implementation domain. Components are identified and represented\\nwithin the context of an architecture that supports them. Finally, specific instantia-\\ntions of the architecture are developed to “prove” the design in a real-world context.\\nAs a simple example of architectural design, the mapping method presented in\\nthis chapter uses data flow characteristics to derive a commonly used architectural\\nstyle. A data flow diagram is mapped into program structure using a transform map-\\nping approach. Transform mapping is applied to an information flow that exhibits\\ndistinct boundaries between incoming and outgoing data. The DFD is mapped into a\\nstructure that allocates control to input, processing, and output along three sepa-\\nrately factored module hierarchies. Once an architecture has been derived, it is elab-\\norated and then analyzed using quality criteria.\\npre75977_ch09.qxd  11/27/08  3:42 PM  Page 273'),\n",

More formally, the\\nOMG Unified Modeling Language Specification [OMG03a] defines a component as \\n“. . . a modular, deployable, and replaceable part of a system that encapsulates\\nimplementation and exposes a set of interfaces.”\\nAs we discussed in Chapter 9, components populate the software architecture\\nand, as a consequence, play a role in achieving the objectives and requirements of\\nthe system to be built. Because components reside within the software architec-\\nture, they must communicate and collaborate with other components and with\\nentities (e.g., other systems, devices, people) that exist outside the boundaries of\\nthe software.\\nThe true meaning of the term componentwill differ depending on the point of view\\nof the software engineer who uses it. In the sections that follow, I examine three im-\\nportant views of what a component is and how it is used as design modeling proceeds.\\n10.1.1 An Object-Oriented View\\nIn the context of object-oriented software engineering, a component contains a set\\nof collaborating classes.\\n1 Each class within a component has been fully elaborated\\nto include all attributes and operations that are relevant to its implementation. As\\npart of the design elaboration, all interfaces that enable the classes to communicate\\nand collaborate with other design classes must also be defined.

The interfaces computeJob and initiateJob imply communication and\\ncollaboration with other components (not shown here).

Once it is completed, further elaboration is applied to each\\nattribute, operation, and interface. The data structures appropriate for each attribute\\nmust be specified. In addition, the algorithmic detail required to implement the pro-\\ncessing logic associated with each operation is designed. This procedural design\\nactivity is discussed later in this chapter. Finally, the mechanisms required to imple-\\nment the interface are designed. For object-oriented software, this may encompass\\nthe description of all messaging that is required to effect communication between\\nobjects within the system.\\n10.1.2 The Traditional View\\nIn the context of traditional software engineering, a component is a functional element\\nof a program that incorporates processing logic, the internal data structures that are re-\\nquired to implement the processing logic, and an interface that enables the component\\nto be invoked and data to be passed to it. A traditional component, also called a module,\\nresides within the software architecture and serves one of three important roles: (1) a\\ncontrol component that coordinates the invocation of all other problem domain com-\\nponents, (2) a problem domain componentthat implements a complete or partial func-\\ntion that is required by the customer, or (3) an infrastructure component that is\\nresponsible for functions that support the processing required in the problem domain.\\nLike object-oriented components, traditional software components are derived\\nfrom the analysis model. In this case, however, the data flow-oriented element of the\\nanalysis model serves as the basis for the derivation. Each transform (bubble) repre-\\nsented at the lowest levels of the data flow diagram is mapped (Section 9.6) into a\\nmodule hierarchy. Control components (modules) reside near the top of the hierar-\\nchy (program architecture), and problem domain components tend to reside toward\\nthe bottom of the hierarchy. To achieve effective modularity, design concepts like\\nfunctional independence (Chapter 8) are applied as components are elaborated.\\nTo illustrate this process of design elaboration for traditional components, again\\nconsider software to be built for a sophisticated print shop.

As the software architecture is developed, you choose\\ncomponents or design patterns from the catalog and use them to populate the architec-\\nture. Because these components have been created with reusability in mind, a complete\\ndescription of their interface, the function(s) they perform, and the communication and\\ncollaboration they require are all available to you. I discuss some of the important\\naspects of component-based software engineering (CBSE) later in Section 10.6.\\nComponent-Based Standards and Frameworks\\nOne of the key elements that lead to the\\nsuccess or failure of CBSE is the availability\\nof component-based standards, sometimes called\\nmiddleware. Middleware is a collection of infrastructure\\ncomponents that enable problem domain components to\\ncommunicate with one another across a network or\\nwithin a complex system. Software engineers who want\\nto use component-based development as their software\\nprocess can choose from among the following\\nstandards:\\nOMG CORBA—www.corba.org/\\nMicrosoft COM—www.microsoft.com/com/\\ntech/complus.asp\\nMicrosoft .NET—http:/ /msdn2.microsoft.com/\\nen-us/netframework/default.aspx\\nSun JavaBeans—http:/ /java.sun.com/\\nproducts/ejb/\\nThe websites noted present a wide array of tutorials, white\\npapers, tools, and general resources on these important\\nmiddleware standards.\\nINFO\\n10.2 D ESIGNING CLASS -B ASED COMPONENTS\\nAs I have already noted, component-level design draws on information developed\\nas part of the requirements model (Chapters 6 and 7) and represented as part of\\nthe architectural model (Chapter 9). When an object-oriented software engineering\\napproach is chosen, component-level design focuses on the elaboration of problem\\ndomain specific classes and the definition and refinement of infrastructure classes\\ncontained in the requirements model. The detailed description of the attributes,\\noperations, and interfaces used by these classes is the design detail required as a\\nprecursor to the construction activity.\\n10.2.1 Basic Design Principles\\nFour basic design principles are applicable to component-level design and have been\\nwidely adopted when object-oriented software engineering is applied. The underlying\\nmotivation for the application of these principles is to create designs that are more\\namenable to change and to reduce the propagation of side effects when changes do\\noccur. You can use these principles as a guide as each software component is developed.\\nThe Open-Closed Principle (OCP). “A module [component] should be open \\nfor extension but closed for modification” [Mar00].

Stated simply, you should specify the component in a way\\nthat allows it to be extended (within the functional domain that it addresses) with-\\nout the need to make internal (code or logic-level) modifications to the component\\nitself. To accomplish this, you create abstractions that serve as a buffer between the\\nfunctionality that is likely to be extended and the design class itself.\\nFor example, assume that the SafeHomesecurity function makes use of a Detector\\nclass that must check the status of each type of security sensor. It is likely that as time\\npasses, the number and types of security sensors will grow. If internal processing logic\\nis implemented as a sequence of if-then-else constructs, each addressing a different\\nsensor type, the addition of a new sensor type will require additional internal pro-\\ncessing logic (still another if-then-else). This is a violation of OCP.\\nOne way to accomplish OCP for the Detector class is illustrated in Figure 10.4.\\nThe sensor interface presents a consistent view of sensors to the detector compo-\\nnent.

This design principle, originally proposed by Barbara Liskov\\n[Lis88], suggests that a component that uses a base class should continue to function\\nproperly if a class derived from the base class is passed to the component instead. LSP\\ndemands that any class derived from a base class must honor any implied contract be-\\ntween the base class and the components that use it. In the context of this discussion,\\na “contract” is a preconditionthat must be true before the component uses a base class\\nand a postcondition that should be true after the component uses a base class. When\\nyou create derived classes, be sure they conform to the pre- and postconditions.\\nDependency Inversion Principle (DIP). “Depend on abstractions. Do not depend\\non concretions” [Mar00]. As we have seen in the discussion of the OCP, abstractions\\nare the place where a design can be extended without great complication. The more\\na component depends on other concrete components (rather than on abstractions\\nsuch as an interface), the more difficult it will be to extend.\\nThe Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). “Many client-specific interfaces\\nare better than one general purpose interface” [Mar00]. There are many instances in\\nwhich multiple client components use the operations provided by a server class. ISP\\nsuggests that you should create a specialized interface to serve each major category\\nof clients. Only those operations that are relevant to a particular category of clients\\nshould be specified in the interface for that client. If multiple clients require the same\\noperations, it should be specified in each of the specialized interfaces.\\nAs an example, consider the FloorPlan class that is used for the SafeHome secu-\\nrity and surveillance functions (Chapter 6). For the security functions, FloorPlan is\\nused only during configuration activities and uses the operations placeDevice(),\\nshowDevice(), groupDevice(), and removeDevice() to place, show, group, and remove\\nsensors from the floor plan.

The interface for security would encompass only the operations placeDevice(),\\nshowDevice(), groupDevice(), and removeDevice(). The interface for surveillance\\nwould incorporate the operations placeDevice(), showDevice(), groupDevice(), and\\nremoveDevice(), along with showFOV() and showDeviceID().\\nAlthough component-level design principles provide useful guidance, compo-\\nnents themselves do not exist in a vacuum. In many cases, individual components\\nor classes are organized into subsystems or packages. It is reasonable to ask how\\nthis packaging activity should occur. Exactly how should components be organized\\nas the design proceeds? Martin [Mar00] suggests additional packaging principles\\nthat are applicable to component-level design:\\nThe Release Reuse Equivalency Principle (REP). “The granule of reuse is the\\ngranule of release”[Mar00]. When classes or components are designed for reuse, there\\nis an implicit contract that is established between the developer of the reusable entity\\nand the people who will use it. The developer commits to establish a release control\\nsystem that supports and maintains older versions of the entity while the users slowly\\nupgrade to the most current version. Rather than addressing each class individually,\\nit is often advisable to group reusable classes into packages that can be managed and\\ncontrolled as newer versions evolve.\\nThe Common Closure Principle (CCP). “Classes that change together belong\\ntogether.”[Mar00]. Classes should be packaged cohesively. That is, when classes are\\npackaged as part of a design, they should address the same functional or behavioral\\narea. When some characteristic of that area must change, it is likely that only those\\nclasses within the package will require modification. This leads to more effective\\nchange control and release management.\\nThe Common Reuse Principle (CRP). “Classes that aren’t reused together should\\nnot be grouped together” [Mar00]. When one or more classes within a package\\nchanges, the release number of the package changes. All other classes or packages\\nthat rely on the package that has been changed must now update to the most recent\\nrelease of the package and be tested to ensure that the new release operates without\\nincident. If classes are not grouped cohesively, it is possible that a class with no rela-\\ntionship to other classes within a package is changed. This will precipitate unneces-\\nsary integration and testing. For this reason, only classes that are reused together\\nshould be included within a package.\\n10.2.2 Component-Level Design Guidelines\\nIn addition to the principles discussed in Section 10.2.1, a set of pragmatic design\\nguidelines can be applied as component-level design proceeds. These guidelines\\napply to components, their interfaces, and the dependencies and inheritance\\nCHAPTER 10 COMPONENT-LEVEL DESIGN 285\\nDesigning components\\nfor reuse requires more\\nthan good technical\\ndesign.

Ambler [Amb02b] sug-\\ngests the following guidelines:\\nComponents. Naming conventions should be established for components that are\\nspecified as part of the architectural model and then refined and elaborated as part\\nof the component-level model. Architectural component names should be drawn\\nfrom the problem domain and should have meaning to all stakeholders who view the\\narchitectural model. For example, the class name FloorPlanis meaningful to every-\\none reading it regardless of technical background. On the other hand, infrastructure\\ncomponents or elaborated component-level classes should be named to reflect\\nimplementation-specific meaning. If a linked list is to be managed as part of the\\nFloorPlan implementation, the operation manageList()is appropriate, even if a non-\\ntechnical person might misinterpret it.\\n3\\nYou can choose to use stereotypes to help identify the nature of components at\\nthe detailed design level. For example, < <infrastructure> >might be used to identify an\\ninfrastructure component, <<database>> could be used to identify a database that\\nservices one or more design classes or the entire system; <<table>> can be used to\\nidentify a table within a database.\\nInterfaces. Interfaces provide important information about communication and\\ncollaboration (as well as helping us to achieve the OCP). However, unfettered repre-\\nsentation of interfaces tends to complicate component diagrams. Ambler [Amb02c]\\nrecommends that (1) lollipop representation of an interface should be used in lieu of\\nthe more formal UML box and dashed arrow approach, when diagrams grow complex;\\n(2) for consistency, interfaces should flow from the left-hand side of the component\\nbox; (3) only those interfaces that are relevant to the component under consideration\\nshould be shown, even if other interfaces are available. These recommendations are\\nintended to simplify the visual nature of UML component diagrams.\\nDependencies and Inheritance. For improved readability, it is a good idea\\nto model dependencies from left to right and inheritance from bottom (derived\\nclasses) to top (base classes). In addition, component interdependencies should\\nbe represented via interfaces, rather than by representation of a component-to-\\ncomponent dependency. Following the philosophy of the OCP, this will help to\\nmake the system more maintainable.\\n10.2.3 Cohesion\\nIn Chapter 8, I described cohesion as the “single-mindedness” of a component.\\nWithin the context of component-level design for object-oriented systems, cohesion\\nWhat should\\nwe consider\\nwhen we name\\ncomponents?\\n?\\n3 It is unlikely that someone from marketing or the customer organization (a nontechnical type)\\nwould examine detailed design information.\\npre75977_ch10.qxd  11/27/08  3:46 PM  Page 286'),\n",

Exhibited primarily by operations, this level of cohesion occurs\\nwhen a component performs a targeted computation and then returns a\\nresult.\\nLayer. Exhibited by packages, components, and classes, this type of cohe-\\nsion occurs when a higher layer accesses the services of a lower layer,\\nbut lower layers do not access higher layers. Consider, for example, the\\nSafeHome security function requirement to make an outgoing phone call if an\\nalarm is sensed. It might be possible to define a set of layered packages as\\nshown in Figure 10.5. The shaded packages contain infrastructure compo-\\nnents.

There is, however,\\na darker side to this important (and necessary) characteristic. As the amount of com-\\nmunication and collaboration increases (i.e., as the degree of “connectedness” between\\nclasses increases), the complexity of the system also increases. And as complexity\\nincreases, the difficulty of implementing, testing, and maintaining software grows.\\nCoupling is a qualitative measure of the degree to which classes are connected to\\none another. As classes (and components) become more interdependent, coupling\\nincreases. An important objective in component-level design is to keep coupling as\\nlow as is possible.\\npre75977_ch10.qxd  11/27/08  3:47 PM  Page 288'),\n",

Identify appropriate interfaces for each component. Within the\\ncontext of component-level design, a UML interface is “a group of externally visible\\n(i.e., public) operations. The interface contains no internal structure, it has no attrib-\\nutes, no associations . . .” [Ben02]. Stated more formally, an interface is the equiva-\\nlent of an abstract class that provides a controlled connection between design\\nclasses. The elaboration of interfaces is illustrated in Figure 10.1. In essence, opera-\\ntions defined for the design class are categorized into one or more abstract classes.\\nEvery operation within the abstract class (the interface) should be cohesive; that is,\\nit should exhibit processing that focuses on one limited function or subfunction.\\nReferring to Figure 10.1, it can be argued that the interface initiateJob does not\\nexhibit sufficient cohesion. In actuality, it performs three different subfunctions—\\nbuilding a work order, checking job priority, and passing a job to production. The\\ninterface design should be refactored. One approach might be to reexamine the de-\\nsign classes and define a new class WorkOrderthat would take care of all activities\\nassociated with the assembly of a work order. The operation buildWorkOrder() be-\\ncomes a part of that class. Similarly, we might define a class JobQueue that would\\nincorporate the operation checkPriority(). A class ProductionJob would encompass\\nall information associated with a production job to be passed to the production\\nfacility. The interface initiateJob would then take the form shown in Figure 10.7.\\nThe interface initiateJob is now cohesive, focusing on one function. The interfaces\\nassociated with ProductionJob, WorkOrder, and JobQueue are similarly \\nsingle-minded.\\nStep 3c.

Each software component is elaborated through a number of iter-\\nations that apply the stepwise refinement concept (Chapter 8).\\nThe first iteration defines each operation as part of the design class. In every case,\\nthe operation should be characterized in a way that ensures high cohesion; that is,\\nthe operation should perform a single targeted function or subfunction. The next\\niteration does little more than expand the operation name. For example, the operation\\ncomputePaperCost()noted in Figure 10.1 can be expanded in the following manner:\\ncomputePaperCost (weight, size, color): numeric\\nThis indicates that computePaperCost()requires the attributes weight, size,and color as\\ninput and returns a value that is numeric (actually a dollar value) as output.\\nIf the algorithm required to implement computePaperCost() is simple and\\nwidely understood, no further design elaboration may be necessary. The software\\nengineer who does the coding will provide the detail necessary to implement the\\noperation. However, if the algorithm is more complex or arcane, further design\\nelaboration is required at this stage. Figure 10.8 depicts a UML activity diagram for\\ncomputePaperCost(). When activity diagrams are used for component-level design\\nspecification, they are generally represented at a level of abstraction that is some-\\nwhat higher than source code. An alternative approach—the use of pseudocode for\\ndesign specification—is discussed in Section 10.5.3.\\nCHAPTER 10 COMPONENT-LEVEL DESIGN 293\\nUse stepwise\\nelaboration as you\\nrefine the component\\ndesign.

The transitions between states (driven by events) are represented using a UML\\nstatechart [Ben02] as illustrated in Figure 10.9.\\nThe transition from one state (represented by a rectangle with rounded corners)\\nto another occurs as a consequence of an event that takes the form:\\nEvent-name (parameter-list) [guard-condition] / action expression\\nwhere event-name identifies the event, parameter-list incorporates data that are\\nassociated with the event, guard-condition is written in Object Constraint Language\\n(OCL) and specifies a condition that must be met before the event can occur, and\\naction expression defines an action that occurs as the transition takes place.\\nReferring to Figure 10.9, each state may define entry/ and exit/ actions that occur as\\ntransition into the state occurs and as transition out of the state occurs, respectively.

However, components generally\\nare not represented individually within a component diagram. The reason for this is\\nto avoid diagrammatic complexity. In some cases, deployment diagrams are elabo-\\nrated into instance form at this time. This means that the specific hardware and\\noperating system environment(s) that will be used is (are) specified and the location\\nof component packages within this environment is indicated.\\nStep 7. Refactor every component-level design representation and always\\nconsider alternatives. Throughout this book, I have emphasized that design\\nis an iterative process. The first component-level model you create will not be as\\ncomplete, consistent, or accurate as the nth iteration you apply to the model. It is\\nessential to refactor as design work is conducted.\\nIn addition, you should not suffer from tunnel vision. There are always alterna-\\ntive design solutions, and the best designers consider all (or most) of them before\\nsettling on the final design model. Develop alternatives and consider each care-\\nfully, using the design principles and concepts presented in Chapter 8 and in this\\nchapter.\\n10.4 C OMPONENT -L EVEL DESIGN FOR WEB APPS\\nThe boundary between content and function is often blurred when Web-based\\nsystems and applications (WebApps) are considered.

Among many capabilities, the user can select and control\\nany of the cameras represented as part of a floor plan, require video-capture thumb-\\nnail images from all the cameras, and display streaming video from any one camera.\\nIn addition, the user can control pan and zoom for a camera using appropriate\\ncontrol icons.\\nA number of potential content components can be defined for the video surveil-\\nlance capability: (1) the content objects that represent the space layout (the floor\\nplan) with additional icons representing the location of sensors and video cameras,\\n(2) the collection of thumbnail video captures (each a separate data object), and\\n(3) the streaming video window for a specific camera. Each of these components can\\nbe separately named and manipulated as a package.\\nConsider a floor plan that depicts four cameras placed strategically throughout a\\nhouse. Upon user request, a video frame is captured from each camera and is iden-\\ntified as a dynamically generated content object, VideoCaptureN, where N identi-\\nfies cameras 1 to 4. A content component, named Thumbnail-Images, combines\\nall four VideoCaptureNcontent objects and displays them on the video surveillance\\npage.\\nThe formality of content design at the component level should be tuned to the\\ncharacteristics of the WebApp to be built. In many cases, content objects need not\\nbe organized as components and can be manipulated individually. However, as the\\nsize and complexity (of the WebApp, content objects, and their interrelationships)\\ngrows, it may be necessary to organize content in a way that allows easier reference\\nand design manipulation.\\n6 In addition, if content is highly dynamic (e.g., the content\\nfor an online auction site), it becomes important to establish a clear structural model\\nthat incorporates content components.\\n10.4.2 Functional Design at the Component Level\\nModern Web applications deliver increasingly sophisticated processing functions\\nthat (1) perform localized processing to generate content and navigation capability\\nin a dynamic fashion, (2) provide computation or data processing capability that is\\nappropriate for the WebApp’s business domain, (3) provide sophisticated database\\nquery and access, or (4) establish data interfaces with external corporate systems.

A functional architecture is a representation of the\\nfunctional domain of the WebApp and describes the key functional components in\\nthe WebApp and how these components interact with each other.\\nFor example, the pan and zoom functions for the SafeHomeAssured.com video\\nsurveillance capability are implemented as part of a CameraControl component.\\nAlternatively, pan and zoom can be implemented as the operations,pan() and zoom(),\\nwhich are part of aCamera class.

In the late 1960s, Dijkstra and others\\nproposed the use of a set of constrained logical constructs from which any program\\ncould be formed. The constructs emphasized “maintenance of functional domain.”\\nThat is, each construct had a predictable logical structure and was entered at the\\ntop and exited at the bottom, enabling a reader to follow procedural flow more\\neasily.\\nThe constructs are sequence, condition, and repetition. Sequence implements\\nprocessing steps that are essential in the specification of any algorithm. Condition\\nprovides the facility for selected processing based on some logical occurrence, and\\nrepetition allows for looping. These three constructs are fundamental to structured\\nprogramming—an important component-level design technique.\\nThe structured constructs were proposed to limit the procedural design of\\nsoftware to a small number of predictable logical structures. Complexity metrics\\n(Chapter 23) indicate that the use of the structured constructs reduces program com-\\nplexity and thereby enhances readability, testability, and maintainability. The use of\\n7 A traditional software component implements an element of processing that addresses a function\\nor subfunction in the problem domain or some capability in the infrastructure domain.

The table is\\ndifficult to misinterpret and may even be used as a machine-readable input to a\\ntable-driven algorithm.\\nDecision table organization is illustrated in Figure 10.11.

The lower left-hand quadrant contains a list of all actions that are\\npossible based on combinations of conditions. The right-hand quadrants form a\\nmatrix that indicates condition combinations and the corresponding actions that\\nwill occur for a specific combination. Therefore, each column of the matrix may be\\ninterpreted as a processing rule. The following steps are applied to develop a deci-\\nsion table:\\n1. List all actions that can be associated with a specific procedure (or component).\\n2. List all conditions (or decisions made) during execution of the procedure.\\n3.

Today, complex, high-quality computer-\\nbased systems must be built in very short time periods and demand a more organ-\\nized approach to reuse.\\nComponent-based software engineering (CBSE) is a process that emphasizes the\\ndesign and construction of computer-based systems using reusable software\\n“components.” Clements [Cle95] describes CBSE in the following way:\\n[CBSE] embodies the “buy, don’t build” philosophy espoused by Fred Brooks and others.\\nIn the same way that early subroutines liberated the programmer from thinking about\\ndetails, [CBSE] shifts the emphasis from programming software to composing software\\nsystems. Implementation has given way to integration as the focus.\\nBut a number of questions arise. Is it possible to construct complex systems by\\nassembling them from a catalog of reusable software components? Can this be\\naccomplished in a cost- and time-effective manner? Can appropriate incentives be\\nestablished to encourage software engineers to reuse rather than reinvent? Is\\nmanagement willing to incur the added expense associated with creating reusable\\nsoftware components? Can the library of components necessary to accomplish reuse\\nbe created in a way that makes it accessible to those who need it? Can components\\nthat do exist be found by those who need them?\\nIncreasingly, the answer to each of these questions is “yes.” In the rest of this\\nsection, I examine some of the issues that must be considered to make CBSE\\nsuccessful within a software engineering organization.\\n10.6.1 Domain Engineering\\nThe intent of domain engineering is to identify, construct, catalog, and disseminate a\\nset of software components that have applicability to existing and future software in\\na particular application domain.\\n9 The overall goal is to establish mechanisms that\\nenable software engineers to share these components—to reuse them—during work\\non new and existing systems.

The steps in the process are defined as:\\n1. Define the domain to be investigated.\\n2. Categorize the items extracted from the domain.\\n3. Collect a representative sample of applications in the domain.\\n4. Analyze each application in the sample and define analysis classes.\\n5. Develop a requirements model for the classes.\\nIt is important to note that domain analysis is applicable to any software engineer-\\ning paradigm and may be applied for conventional as well as object-oriented\\ndevelopment.\\n10.6.2 Component Qualification, Adaptation, and Composition\\nDomain engineering provides the library of reusable components that are required\\nfor component-based software engineering. Some of these reusable components are\\ndeveloped in-house, others can be extracted from existing applications, and still\\nothers may be acquired from third parties.\\nUnfortunately, the existence of reusable components does not guarantee that\\nthese components can be integrated easily or effectively into the architecture chosen\\nfor a new application. It is for this reason that a sequence of component-based\\ndevelopment actions is applied when a component is proposed for use.\\nComponent Qualification. Component qualification ensures that a candidate\\ncomponent will perform the function required, will properly “fit” into the architectural\\nstyle (Chapter 9) specified for the system, and will exhibit the quality characteristics\\n(e.g., performance, reliability, usability) that are required for the application.\\nAn interface description provides useful information about the operation and use of\\na software component, but it does not provide all of the information required to deter-\\nmine if a proposed component can, in fact, be reused effectively in a new application.\\nAmong the many factors considered during component qualification are [Bro96]:\\n• Application programming interface (API).\\n• Development and integration tools required by the component.\\n• Run-time requirements, including resource usage (e.g., memory or storage),\\ntiming or speed, and network protocol.\\n• Service requirements, including operating system interfaces and support\\nfrom other components.\\n• Security features, including access controls and authentication protocol.\\n• Embedded design assumptions, including the use of specific numerical or\\nnonnumerical algorithms.\\n• Exception handling.\\nThe analysis process\\nwe discuss in this\\nsection focuses on\\nreusable components.\\nHowever, the analysis\\nof complete COTS\\nsystems (e.g., \\ne-commerce Apps,\\nsales force automation\\nApps) can also be a\\npart of domain\\nanalysis.\\nWhat \\nfactors are\\nconsidered during\\ncomponent\\nqualification?\\n?\\npre75977_ch10.qxd  11/27/08  3:47 PM  Page 304'),\n",

If good software engineering practices\\nwere applied during the development of a component, answers to the questions\\nimplied by the list can be developed. However, it is much more difficult to determine\\nthe internal workings of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or third-party components\\nbecause the only available information may be the interface specification itself.\\nComponent Adaptation. In an ideal setting, domain engineering creates a library\\nof components that can be easily integrated into an application architecture. The\\nimplication of “easy integration” is that (1) consistent methods of resource manage-\\nment have been implemented for all components in the library, (2) common activi-\\nties such as data management exist for all components, and (3) interfaces within the\\narchitecture and with the external environment have been implemented in a consis-\\ntent manner.\\nIn reality, even after a component has been qualified for use within an application\\narchitecture, conflicts may occur in one or more of the areas just noted. To avoid\\nthese conflicts, an adaptation technique called component wrapping[Bro96] is some-\\ntimes used. When a software team has full access to the internal design and code for\\na component (often not the case unless open-source COTS components are used),\\nwhite-box wrapping is applied. Like its counterpart in software testing (Chapter 18),\\nwhite-box wrapping examines the internal processing details of the component and\\nmakes code-level modifications to remove any conflict. Gray-box wrapping is applied\\nwhen the component library provides a component extension language or API that\\nenables conflicts to be removed or masked. Black-box wrapping requires the intro-\\nduction of pre- and postprocessing at the component interface to remove or mask\\nconflicts. You must determine whether the effort required to adequately wrap a com-\\nponent is justified or whether a custom component (designed to eliminate the\\nconflicts encountered) should be engineered instead.\\nComponent Composition. The component composition task assembles quali-\\nfied, adapted, and engineered components to populate the architecture established\\nfor an application. To accomplish this, an infrastructure must be established to bind\\nthe components into an operational system. The infrastructure (usually a library of\\nspecialized components) provides a model for the coordination of components and\\nspecific services that enable components to coordinate with one another and\\nperform common tasks.\\nBecause the potential impact of reuse and CBSE on the software industry is\\nenormous, a number of major companies and industry consortia have proposed\\nstandards for component software.\\n10\\nCHAPTER 10 COMPONENT-LEVEL DESIGN 305\\nIn addition to assessing\\nwhether the cost of\\nadaptation for reuse is\\njustified, you should\\nalso assess whether\\nachieving required\\nfunctionality and\\nperformance can be\\ndone cost effectively.\\n10 Greg Olsen [Ols06] provides an excellent discussion of past and present industry efforts to make\\nCBSE a reality.\\npre75977_ch10.qxd  11/27/08  3:47 PM  Page 305'),\n",

Microsoft has developed a component object\\nmodel (COM) that provides a specification for using components produced by\\nvarious vendors within a single application running under the Windows op-\\nerating system. From the point of view of the application, “the focus is not on\\nhow [COM objects are] implemented, only on the fact that the object has an\\ninterface that it registers with the system, and that it uses the component\\nsystem to communicate with other COM objects” [Har98a].

The JavaBeans component system is a\\nportable, platform-independent CBSE infrastructure developed using the Java\\nprogramming language. The JavaBeans component system encompasses a\\nset of tools, called the Bean Development Kit (BDK), that allows developers to\\n(1) analyze how existing Beans (components) work, (2) customize their\\nbehavior and appearance, (3) establish mechanisms for coordination and\\ncommunication, (4) develop custom Beans for use in a specific application,\\nand (5) test and evaluate Bean behavior.\\nNone of these standards dominate the industry.

If specification matching points to an existing com-\\nponent that fits the needs of the current application, you can extract the component\\nfrom a reuse library (repository) and use it in the design of a new system. If compo-\\nnents cannot be found (i.e., there is no match), a new component is created. It is at\\nthis point—when you begin to create a new component—that design for reuse (DFR)\\nshould be considered.\\nAs we have already noted, DFR requires that you apply solid software design con-\\ncepts and principles (Chapter 8). But the characteristics of the application domain\\nmust also be considered. Binder [Bin93] suggests a number of key issues\\n11 that form\\na basis for design for reuse:\\nStandard data. The application domain should be investigated and standard\\nglobal data structures (e.g., file structures or a complete database) should be\\nidentified. All design components can then be characterized to make use of\\nthese standard data structures.\\nStandard interface protocols. Three levels of interface protocol should be\\nestablished: the nature of intramodular interfaces, the design of external\\ntechnical (nonhuman) interfaces, and the human-computer interface.\\nProgram templates. An architectural style (Chapter 9) is chosen and can\\nserve as a template for the architectural design of a new software.\\nOnce standard data, interfaces, and program templates have been established, you\\nhave a framework in which to create the design. New components that conform to\\nthis framework have a higher probability for subsequent reuse.\\n10.6.4 Classifying and Retrieving Components\\nConsider a large university library. Hundreds of thousands of books, periodicals, and\\nother information resources are available for use. But to access these resources,\\na categorization scheme must be developed.

All\\nenable the user to find the needed resource quickly and easily.\\nNow, consider a large component repository. Tens of thousands of reusable soft-\\nware components reside in it. But how do you find the one that you need? To answer\\nthis question, another question arises: How do we describe software components in\\nunambiguous, classifiable terms? These are difficult questions, and no definitive\\nanswer has yet been developed.

The conceptof a software component is “a description of what\\nthe component does” [Whi95]. The interface to the component is fully described and\\nthe semantics—represented within the context of pre- and postconditions—is iden-\\ntified. The concept should communicate the intent of the component. The contentof\\na component describes how the concept is realized. In essence, the content is infor-\\nmation that is hidden from casual users and need be known only to those who intend\\nto modify or test the component. The context places a reusable software component\\nwithin its domain of applicability. That is, by specifying conceptual, operational, and\\nimplementation features, the context enables a software engineer to find the appro-\\npriate component to meet application requirements.\\nTo be of use in a pragmatic setting, concept, content, and context must be trans-\\nlated into a concrete specification scheme. Dozens of papers and articles have been\\nwritten about classification schemes for reusable software components (e.g., see\\n[Cec06] for an overview of current trends).\\nClassification enables you to find and retrieve candidate reusable components,\\nbut a reuse environment must exist to integrate these components effectively. A\\nreuse environment exhibits the following characteristics:\\n• A component database capable of storing software components and the clas-\\nsification information necessary to retrieve them.\\n• A library management system that provides access to the database.\\n• A software component retrieval system (e.g., an object request broker) that\\nenables a client application to retrieve components and services from the\\nlibrary server.\\n• CBSE tools that support the integration of reused components into a new\\ndesign or implementation.\\nEach of these functions interact with or is embodied within the confines of a reuse\\nlibrary.\\nThe reuse library is one element of a larger software repository (Chapter 22) and\\nprovides facilities for the storage of software components and a wide variety of\\nreusable work products (e.g., specifications, designs, patterns, frameworks, code\\nfragments, test cases, user guides). The library encompasses a database and the\\ntools that are necessary to query the database and retrieve components from it. The\\ncomponent classification scheme serves as the basis for library queries.\\nQueries are often characterized using the context element of the 3C model de-\\nscribed earlier in this section. If an initial query results in a voluminous list of candi-\\ndate components, the query is refined to narrow the list.

The traditional view refines three different types of components or modules:\\ncontrol modules, problem domain modules, and infrastructure modules. In both\\ncases, basic design principles and concepts that lead to high-quality software are ap-\\nplied.

First, a set\\nof golden rules (discussed in Section 11.1) were identified. These applied to all hu-\\nman interaction with technology products. Second, a set of interaction mechanisms\\nwere defined to enable software designers to build systems that properly imple-\\nmented the golden rules. These interaction mechanisms, collectively called the\\ngraphical user interface (GUI), have eliminated some of the most egregious problems\\nassociated with human interfaces. But even in a “Windows world,” we all have\\nencountered user interfaces that are difficult to learn, difficult to use, confusing,\\ncounterintuitive, unforgiving, and in many cases, totally frustrating. Yet, someone\\nspent time and energy building each of these interfaces, and it is not likely that the\\nbuilder created these problems purposely.\\n11.1 T HE GOLDEN RULES\\nIn his book on interface design, Theo Mandel [Man97] coins three golden rules:\\n1. Place the user in control.\\n2. Reduce the user’s memory load.\\n3. Make the interface consistent.\\nThese golden rules actually form the basis for a set of user interface design princi-\\nples that guide this important aspect of software design.\\n11.1.1 Place the User in Control\\nDuring a requirements-gathering session for a major new information system, a key\\nuser was asked about the attributes of the window-oriented graphical interface.\\n“What I really would like,” said the user solemnly, “is a system that reads my mind.\\nIt knows what I want to do before I need to do it and makes it very easy for me to get\\nit done. That’s all, just that.”\\nMy first reaction was to shake my head and smile, but I paused for a moment.\\nThere was absolutely nothing wrong with the user’s request. She wanted a system\\nthat reacted to her needs and helped her get things done. She wanted to control the\\ncomputer, not have the computer control her.\\nMost interface constraints and restrictions that are imposed by a designer are\\nintended to simplify the mode of interaction. But for whom?\\nAs a designer, you may be tempted to introduce constraints and limitations to\\nsimplify the implementation of the interface. The result may be an interface that is\\neasy to build, but frustrating to use. Mandel [Man97] defines a number of design\\nprinciples that allow the user to maintain control:\\nDefine interaction modes in a way that does not force a user into unneces-\\nsary or undesired actions. An interaction mode is the current state of the inter-\\nface.

There is no reason to force the user to remain in\\nspell-checking mode if the user desires to make a small text edit along the way. The\\nuser should be able to enter and exit the mode with little or no effort.\\nProvide for flexible interaction. Because different users have different interac-\\ntion preferences, choices should be provided. For example, software might allow a\\nuser to interact via keyboard commands, mouse movement, a digitizer pen, a mul-\\ntitouch screen, or voice recognition commands. But every action is not amenable to\\nevery interaction mechanism. Consider, for example, the difficulty of using keyboard\\ncommand (or voice input) to draw a complex shape.\\nAllow user interaction to be interruptible and undoable. Even when involved\\nin a sequence of actions, the user should be able to interrupt the sequence to do\\nsomething else (without losing the work that had been done). The user should also\\nbe able to “undo” any action.\\nStreamline interaction as skill levels advance and allow the interaction to\\nbe customized. Users often find that they perform the same sequence of interac-\\ntions repeatedly. It is worthwhile to design a “macro” mechanism that enables an\\nadvanced user to customize the interface to facilitate interaction.\\nHide technical internals from the casual user. The user interface should move\\nthe user into the virtual world of the application. The user should not be aware of the\\noperating system, file management functions, or other arcane computing technol-\\nogy. In essence, the interface should never require that the user interact at a level\\nthat is “inside” the machine (e.g., a user should never be required to type operating\\nsystem commands from within application software).\\nDesign for direct interaction with objects that appear on the screen. The\\nuser feels a sense of control when able to manipulate the objects that are necessary\\nto perform a task in a manner similar to what would occur if the object were a phys-\\nical thing. For example, an application interface that allows a user to “stretch” an\\nobject (scale it in size) is an implementation of direct manipulation.\\n11.1.2 Reduce the User’s Memory Load\\nThe more a user has to remember, the more error-prone the interaction with the\\nsystem will be. It is for this reason that a well-designed user interface does not tax\\nthe user’s memory. Whenever possible, the system should “remember” pertinent in-\\nformation and assist the user with an interaction scenario that assists recall. Man-\\ndel [Man97] defines design principles that enable an interface to reduce the user’s\\nmemory load:\\nReduce demand on short-term memory. When users are involved in complex\\ntasks, the demand on short-term memory can be significant. The interface should be\\ndesigned to reduce the requirement to remember past actions, inputs, and results.\\nuote:\\n“I have always\\nwished that my\\ncomputer would be\\nas easy to use as\\nmy telephone.

The initial set of defaults should make sense for\\nthe average user, but a user should be able to specify individual preferences. How-\\never, a “reset” option should be available, enabling the redefinition of original default\\nvalues.\\nDefine shortcuts that are intuitive. When mnemonics are used to accomplish\\na system function (e.g., alt-P to invoke the print function), the mnemonic should be\\ntied to the action in a way that is easy to remember (e.g., first letter of the task to be\\ninvoked).\\nThe visual layout of the interface should be based on a real-world\\nmetaphor. For example, a bill payment system should use a checkbook and check\\nregister metaphor to guide the user through the bill paying process. This enables the\\nuser to rely on well-understood visual cues, rather than memorizing an arcane\\ninteraction sequence.\\nDisclose information in a progressive fashion. The interface should be or-\\nganized hierarchically. That is, information about a task, an object, or some be-\\nhavior should be presented first at a high level of abstraction. More detail should\\nbe presented after the user indicates interest with a mouse pick. An example, com-\\nmon to many word-processing applications, is the underlining function. The func-\\ntion itself is one of a number of functions under a text style menu. However, every\\nunderlining capability is not listed.

You\\nbegin by delineating the human- and computer-oriented tasks that are required to\\nachieve system function and then considering the design issues that apply to all\\ninterface designs. Tools are used to prototype and ultimately implement the design\\nmodel, and the result is evaluated by end users for quality.\\n11.2.1 Interface Analysis and Design Models\\nFour different models come into play when a user interface is to be analyzed and de-\\nsigned. A human engineer (or the software engineer) establishes a user model, the\\nsoftware engineer creates a design model,the end user develops a mental image that\\nis often called the user’s mental modelor the system perception,and the implementers\\nUsability\\nIn an insightful paper on usability, Larry\\nConstantine [Con95] asks a question that has\\nsignificant bearing on the subject: “What do users want,\\nanyway?” He answers this way:\\nWhat users really want are good tools. All software\\nsystems, from operating systems and languages to\\ndata entry and decision support applications, are\\njust tools. End users want from the tools we\\nengineer for them much the same as we expect from\\nthe tools we use. They want systems that are easy to\\nlearn and that help them do their work. They want\\nsoftware that doesn’t slow them down, that doesn’t\\ntrick or confuse them, that doesn’t make it easier to\\nmake mistakes or harder to finish the job.\\nConstantine argues that usability is not derived from\\naesthetics, state-of-the-art interaction mechanisms, or \\nbuilt-in interface intelligence. Rather, it occurs when the\\narchitecture of the interface fits the needs of the people\\nwho will be using it.\\nA formal definition of usability is somewhat illusive.\\nDonahue and his colleagues [Don99] define it in the\\nfollowing manner: “Usability is a measure of how well\\na computer system . . . facilitates learning; helps learners\\nremember what they’ve learned; reduces the likelihood\\nof errors; enables them to be efficient, and makes them\\nsatisfied with the system.”\\nThe only way to determine whether “usability” exists\\nwithin a system you are building is to conduct usability\\nassessment or testing. Watch users interact with the system\\nand answer the following questions [Con95]:\\n• Is the system usable without continual help or instruction?\\n• Do the rules of interaction help a knowledgeable user\\nto work efficiently?\\n• Do interaction mechanisms become more flexible as\\nusers become more knowledgeable?\\n• Has the system been tuned to the physical and social\\nenvironment in which it will be used?\\n• Is the user aware of the state of the system? Does the\\nuser know where she is at all times?\\n• Is the interface structured in a logical and consistent\\nmanner?\\n• Are interaction mechanisms, icons, and procedures\\nconsistent across the interface?\\n• Does the interaction anticipate errors and help the user\\ncorrect them?\\n• Is the interface tolerant of errors that are made?\\n• Is the interaction simple?\\nIf each of these questions is answered “yes,” it is likely that\\nusability has been achieved.\\nAmong the many measurable benefits derived from a\\nusable system are [Don99]: increased sales and customer\\nsatisfaction, competitive advantage, better reviews in the\\nmedia, better word of mouth, reduced support costs,\\nimproved end-user productivity, reduced training costs,\\nreduced documentation costs, reduced likelihood of\\nlitigation from unhappy customers.\\nINFO\\nWebRef\\nAn excellent source of\\nUI design information\\ncan be found at \\nwww.useit.com.\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:55 PM  Page 317'),\n",

Unfortunately, each of these models\\nmay differ significantly. Your role, as an interface designer, is to reconcile these dif-\\nferences and derive a consistent representation of the interface.\\nThe user model establishes the profile of end users of the system. In his introduc-\\ntory column on “user-centric design,” Jeff Patton [Pat07] notes:\\nThe truth is, designers and developers—myself included—often think about users. How-\\never, in the absence of a strong mental model of specific users, we self-substitute. Self-\\nsubstitution isn’t user centric—it’s self-centric.\\nTo build an effective user interface, “all design should begin with an understanding\\nof the intended users, including profiles of their age, gender, physical abilities, edu-\\ncation, cultural or ethnic background, motivation, goals and personality” [Shn04]. In\\naddition, users can be categorized as:\\nNovices. No syntactic knowledge\\n1 of the system and little semantic knowledge2\\nof the application or computer usage in general.\\nKnowledgeable, intermittent users. Reasonable semantic knowledge of the appli-\\ncation but relatively low recall of syntactic information necessary to use the\\ninterface.\\nKnowledgeable, frequent users. Good semantic and syntactic knowledge that of-\\nten leads to the “power-user syndrome”; that is, individuals who look for short-\\ncuts and abbreviated modes of interaction.\\nThe user’s mental model(system perception) is the image of the system that end\\nusers carry in their heads. For example, if the user of a particular word processor\\nwere asked to describe its operation, the system perception would guide the re-\\nsponse. The accuracy of the description will depend upon the user’s profile (e.g.,\\nnovices would provide a sketchy response at best) and overall familiarity with soft-\\nware in the application domain. A user who understands word processors fully but\\nhas worked with the specific word processor only once might actually be able to pro-\\nvide a more complete description of its function than the novice who has spent\\nweeks trying to learn the system.\\nThe implementation model combines the outward manifestation of the computer-\\nbased system (the look and feel of the interface), coupled with all supporting infor-\\nmation (books, manuals, videotapes, help files) that describes interface syntax and\\nsemantics. When the implementation model and the user’s mental model are coin-\\ncident, users generally feel comfortable with the software and use it effectively. To\\naccomplish this “melding” of the models, the design model must have been\\nuote:\\n“If there’s a ’trick’\\nto it, the UI is\\nbroken.”\\nDouglas\\nAnderson\\nEven a novice user\\nwants shortcuts; even\\nknowledgeable,\\nfrequent users\\nsometimes need\\nguidance.

Referring to\\nFigure 11.1, the user interface analysis and design process begins at the interior of\\nthe spiral and encompasses four distinct framework activities [Man97]: (1) interface\\nanalysis and modeling, (2) interface design, (3) interface construction, and (4) inter-\\nface validation. The spiral shown in Figure 11.1 implies that each of these tasks will\\noccur more than once, with each pass around the spiral representing additional\\nelaboration of requirements and the resultant design. In most cases, the construc-\\ntion activity involves prototyping—the only practical way to validate what has been\\ndesigned.\\nInterface analysis focuses on the profile of the users who will interact with the\\nsystem.

Among the\\nquestions to be asked are\\n• Where will the interface be located physically?\\n• Will the user be sitting, standing, or performing other tasks unrelated to the\\ninterface?\\n• Does the interface hardware accommodate space, light, or noise constraints?\\n• Are there special human factors considerations driven by environmental\\nfactors?\\nThe information gathered as part of the analysis action is used to create an analysis\\nmodel for the interface.

In the sections that\\nfollow, I examine each of these elements of interface analysis with the intent of\\nestablishing a solid foundation for the design tasks that follow.\\n11.3.1 User Analysis\\nThe phrase “user interface” is probably all the justification needed to spend some\\ntime understanding the user before worrying about technical matters. Earlier I noted\\nthat each user has a mental image of the software that may be different from the\\nmental image developed by other users. In addition, the user’s mental image may be\\nvastly different from the software engineer’s design model. The only way that you\\ncan get the mental image and the design model to converge is to work to understand\\nthe users themselves as well as how these people will use the system. Information\\nfrom a broad array of sources can be used to accomplish this:\\nUser Interviews. The most direct approach, members of the software team\\nmeet with end users to better understand their needs, motivations, work cul-\\nture, and a myriad of other issues. This can be accomplished in one-on-one\\nmeetings or through focus groups.\\nSales input. Sales people meet with users on a regular basis and can gather\\ninformation that will help the software team to categorize users and better\\nunderstand their requirements.\\nMarketing input. Market analysis can be invaluable in the definition of\\nmarket segments and an understanding of how each segment might use the\\nsoftware in subtly different ways.\\nSupport input. Support staff talks with users on a daily basis. They are the\\nmost likely source of information on what works and what doesn’t, what\\nusers like and what they dislike, what features generate questions and what\\nfeatures are easy to use.\\nThe following set of questions (adapted from [Hac98]) will help you to better\\nunderstand the users of a system:\\n• Are users trained professionals, technicians, clerical, or manufacturing\\nworkers?\\n• What level of formal education does the average user have?\\n• Are the users capable of learning from written materials or have they\\nexpressed a desire for classroom training?\\n• Are users expert typists or keyboard phobic?\\n• What is the age range of the user community?\\n• Will the users be represented predominately by one gender?\\n• How are users compensated for the work they perform?\\nHow do we\\nlearn what\\nthe user wants\\nfrom the UI?\\n?\\nAbove all, spend time\\ntalking to actual users,\\nbut be careful. One\\nstrong opinion doesn’t\\nnecessarily mean that\\nthe majority of users\\nwill agree.\\nHow do we learn\\nabout the\\ndemographics and\\ncharacteristics of end\\nusers?\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:55 PM  Page 321'),\n",

In earlier chapters you learned that the use case describes the manner\\nin which an actor (in the context of user interface design, an actor is always a person)\\ninteracts with a system. When used as part of task analysis, the use case is devel-\\noped to show how an end user performs some specific work-related task. In most\\ninstances, the use case is written in an informal style (a simple paragraph) in the\\nfirst-person. For example, assume that a small software company wants to build\\na computer-aided design system explicitly for interior designers. To get a better\\nunderstanding of how they do their work, actual interior designers are asked to\\ndescribe a specific design function. When asked: “How do you decide where to put\\nfurniture in a room?” an interior designer writes the following informal use case:\\nI begin by sketching the floor plan of the room, the dimensions and the location of win-\\ndows and doors. I’m very concerned about light as it enters the room, about the view out\\nof the windows (if it’s beautiful, I want to draw attention to it), about the running length\\nof an unobstructed wall, about the flow of movement through the room. I then look at the\\nlist of furniture my customer and I have chosen—tables, chairs, sofa, cabinets, the list of\\nThe user’s goal is to\\naccomplish one or\\nmore tasks via the UI.\\nTo accomplish this, \\nthe UI must provide\\nmechanisms that allow\\nthe user to achieve \\nher goal.\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:55 PM  Page 322'),\n",

I then draw each item from my lists using a tem-\\nplate that is scaled to the floor plan. I label each item I draw and use pencil because I al-\\nways move things. I consider a number of alternative placements and decide on the one\\nI like best. Then, I draw a rendering (a 3-D picture) of the room to give my customer a feel\\nfor what it’ll look like.\\nThis use case provides a basic description of one important work task for the\\ncomputer-aided design system. From it, you can extract tasks, objects, and the\\noverall flow of the interaction. In addition, other features of the system that would\\nplease the interior designer might also be conceived. For example, a digital photo\\ncould be taken looking out each window in a room. When the room is rendered, the\\nactual outside view could be represented through each window.\\nUse Cases for UI Design\\nThe scene: Vinod’s cubicle, as user\\ninterface design continues.\\nThe players: Vinod and Jamie, members of the\\nSafeHome software engineering team.\\nThe conversation:\\nJamie: I pinned down our marketing contact and had\\nher write a use case for the surveillance interface.\\nVinod: From whose point of view?\\nJamie: The homeowner, who else is there?\\nVinod: There’s also the system administrator role, even\\nif it’s the homeowner playing the role, it’s a different point\\nof view. The “administrator” sets the system up, configures\\nstuff, lays out the floor plan, places the cameras . . .\\nJamie: All I had her do was play the role of the\\nhomeowner when he wants to see video.\\nVinod: That’s okay. It’s one of the major behaviors of the\\nsurveillance function interface.

Here’s what we came \\nup with.\\n[Jamie shows the informal use case to Vinod.]\\nInformal use case: I want to be able to set or edit\\nthe system layout at any time. When I set up the system,\\nI select an administration function. It asks me whether \\nI want to do a new setup or whether I want to edit \\nan existing setup. If I select a new setup, the system\\ndisplays a drawing screen that will enable me to draw\\nthe floor plan onto a grid. There will be icons for walls,\\nwindows, and doors so that drawing is easy. I just\\nstretch the icons to their appropriate lengths. The system\\nwill display the lengths in feet or meters (I can select \\nthe measurement system). I can select from a library\\nof sensors and cameras and place them on the floor\\nplan. I get to label each, or the system will do automatic\\nlabeling. I can establish settings for sensors and cameras\\nfrom appropriate menus. If I select edit, I can move\\nsensors or cameras, add new ones or delete existing\\nones, edit the floor plan, and edit the settings for\\ncameras and sensors. In every case, I expect the system\\nto do consistency checking and to help me avoid\\nmistakes.\\nVinod (after reading the scenario): Okay, there\\nare probably some useful design patterns [Chapter 12] or\\nreusable components for GUIs for drawing programs.

In Chapter 8, I discussed stepwise elaboration (also called func-\\ntional decomposition or stepwise refinement) as a mechanism for refining the pro-\\ncessing tasks that are required for software to accomplish some desired function.\\nTask analysis for interface design uses an elaborative approach to assist in under-\\nstanding the human activities the user interface must accommodate.\\nTask analysis can be applied in two ways. As I have already noted, an interactive,\\ncomputer-based system is often used to replace a manual or semimanual activity. To\\nunderstand the tasks that must be performed to accomplish the goal of the activity, you\\nmust understand the tasks that people currently perform (when using a manual ap-\\nproach) and then map these into a similar (but not necessarily identical) set of tasks that\\nare implemented in the context of the user interface. Alternatively, you can study an\\nexisting specification for a computer-based solution and derive a set of user tasks that\\nwill accommodate the user model, the design model, and the system perception.\\nRegardless of the overall approach to task analysis, you must first define and clas-\\nsify tasks. I have already noted that one approach is stepwise elaboration. For\\nexample, let’s reconsider the computer-aided design system for interior designers dis-\\ncussed earlier. By observing an interior designer at work, you notice that interior\\ndesign comprises a number of major activities: furniture layout (note the use case dis-\\ncussed earlier), fabric and material selection, wall and window coverings selection,\\npresentation (to the customer), costing, and shopping. Each of these major tasks can\\nbe elaborated into subtasks. For example, using information contained in the use case,\\nfurniture layout can be refined into the following tasks: (1) draw a floor plan based on\\nroom dimensions, (2) place windows and doors at appropriate locations, (3a) use fur-\\nniture templates to draw scaled furniture outlines on the floor plan, (3b) use accents\\ntemplates to draw scaled accents on the floor plan, (4) move furniture outlines and\\naccent outlines to get the best placement, (5) label all furniture and accent outlines,\\n(6) draw dimensions to show location, and (7) draw a perspective-rendering view for\\nthe customer. A similar approach could be used for each of the other major tasks.\\nSubtasks 1 to 7 can each be refined further. Subtasks 1 to 6 will be performed by\\nmanipulating information and performing actions within the user interface. On the\\nother hand, subtask 7 can be performed automatically in software and will result in\\nlittle direct user interaction.\\n4 The design model of the interface should accommodate\\neach of these tasks in a way that is consistent with the user model (the profile of a\\n“typical” interior designer) and system perception (what the interior designer expects\\nfrom an automated system).\\nObject elaboration. Rather than focusing on the tasks that a user must perform,\\nyou can examine the use case and other information obtained from the user and\\nextract the physical objects that are used by the interior designer. These objects can\\nTask elaboration is\\nquite useful, but it can\\nalso be dangerous.\\nJust because you have\\nelaborated a task, do\\nnot assume that there\\nisn’t another way to\\ndo it, and that the\\nother way will be\\ntried when the UI is\\nimplemented.\\n4 However, this may not be the case. The interior designer might want to specify the perspective to be\\ndrawn, the scaling, the use of color, and other information. The use case related to drawing per-\\nspective renderings would provide the information you need to address this task.\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:55 PM  Page 324'),\n",

Attributes of each class are defined, and an evaluation\\nof the actions applied to each object provide a list of operations. For example, the\\nfurniture template might translate into a class called Furniture with attributes that\\nmight include size, shape, location, and others. The interior designer would select the\\nobject from the Furniture class, move it to a position on the floor plan (another ob-\\nject in this context), draw the furniture outline, and so forth. The tasks select, move,\\nand draw are operations. The user interface analysis model would not provide a lit-\\neral implementation for each of these operations. However, as the design is elabo-\\nrated, the details of each operation are defined.\\nWorkflow analysis. When a number of different users, each playing different\\nroles, makes use of a user interface, it is sometimes necessary to go beyond task\\nanalysis and object elaboration and apply workflow analysis. This technique allows\\nyou to understand how a work process is completed when several people (and roles)\\nare involved. Consider a company that intends to fully automate the process of pre-\\nscribing and delivering prescription drugs. The entire process\\n5 will revolve around a\\nWeb-based application that is accessible by physicians (or their assistants), pharma-\\ncists, and patients. Workflow can be represented effectively with a UML swimlane\\ndiagram (a variation on the activity diagram).\\nWe consider only a small part of the work process: the situation that occurs when\\na patient asks for a refill. Figure 11.2 presents a swimlane diagram that indicates the\\ntasks and decisions for each of the three roles noted earlier. This information may\\nhave been elicited via interview or from use cases written by each actor. Regardless,\\nthe flow of events (shown in the figure) enables you to recognize a number of key\\ninterface characteristics:\\n1. Each user implements different tasks via the interface; therefore, the look and\\nfeel of the interface designed for the patient will be different than the one\\ndefined for pharmacists or physicians.\\n2. The interface design for pharmacists and physicians must accommodate\\naccess to and display of information from secondary information sources\\n(e.g., access to inventory for the pharmacist and access to information about\\nalternative medications for the physician).\\n3. Many of the activities noted in the swimlane diagram can be further elabo-\\nrated using task analysis and/or object elaboration (e.g., Fills prescription\\ncould imply a mail-order delivery, a visit to a pharmacy, or a visit to a special\\ndrug distribution center).\\nHierarchical representation. A process of elaboration occurs as you begin to\\nanalyze the interface. Once workflow has been established, a task hierarchy can be\\ndefined for each user type. The hierarchy is derived by a stepwise elaboration of\\nAlthough object\\nelaboration is useful,\\nit should not be used \\nas a stand-alone\\napproach.

For modern applications, display content can range from\\ncharacter-based reports (e.g., a spreadsheet), graphical displays (e.g., a histogram,\\na 3-D model, a picture of a person), or specialized information (e.g., audio or video\\nfiles). The analysis modeling techniques discussed in Chapters 6 and 7 identify the\\noutput data objects that are produced by an application.

Among the questions that are asked\\nand answered are:\\n• Are different types of data assigned to consistent geographic locations on\\nthe screen (e.g., photos always appear in the upper right-hand corner)?\\n• Can the user customize the screen location for content?\\n• Is proper on-screen identification assigned to all content?\\n• If a large report is to be presented, how should it be partitioned for ease of\\nunderstanding?\\n• Will mechanisms be available for moving directly to summary information for\\nlarge collections of data?\\n• Will graphical output be scaled to fit within the bounds of the display device\\nthat is used?\\n• How will color be used to enhance understanding?\\n• How will error messages and warnings be presented to the user?\\nThe answers to these (and other) questions will help you to establish requirements\\nfor content presentation.\\nHow do we\\ndetermine\\nthe format and\\naesthetics of\\ncontent displayed\\nas part of the UI?\\n?\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:56 PM  Page 327'),\n",

They are influenced by the activity around\\nthem, the physical characteristics of the workplace, the type of equipment they are using,\\nand the work relationships they have with other people. If the products you design do not\\nfit into the environment, they may be difficult or frustrating to use.\\nIn some applications the user interface for a computer-based system is placed in a\\n“user-friendly location” (e.g., proper lighting, good display height, easy keyboard\\naccess), but in others (e.g., a factory floor or an airplane cockpit), lighting may be\\nsuboptimal, noise may be a factor, a keyboard or mouse may not be an option, dis-\\nplay placement may be less than ideal. The interface designer may be constrained by\\nfactors that mitigate against ease of use.\\nIn addition to physical environmental factors, the workplace culture also comes\\ninto play. Will system interaction be measured in some manner (e.g., time per trans-\\naction or accuracy of a transaction)? Will two or more people have to share infor-\\nmation before an input can be provided? How will support be provided to users of\\nthe system? These and many related questions should be answered before the inter-\\nface design commences.\\n11.4 I NTERFACE DESIGN STEPS\\nOnce interface analysis has been completed, all tasks (or objects and actions)\\nrequired by the end user have been identified in detail and the interface design\\nactivity commences. Interface design, like all software engineering design, is an it-\\nerative process. Each user interface design step occurs a number of times, elaborat-\\ning and refining information developed in the preceding step.\\nAlthough many different user interface design models (e.g., [Nor86], [Nie00]) have\\nbeen proposed, all suggest some combination of the following steps:\\n1. Using information developed during interface analysis (Section 11.3), define\\ninterface objects and actions (operations).\\n2. Define events (user actions) that will cause the state of the user interface to\\nchange. Model this behavior.\\n3. Depict each interface state as it will actually look to the end user.\\n4.

To accomplish this, user scenarios are parsed\\nin much the same way as described in Chapter 6. That is, a use case is written.\\nNouns (objects) and verbs (actions) are isolated to create a list of objects and\\nactions.\\nOnce the objects and actions have been defined and elaborated iteratively, they\\nare categorized by type. Target, source, and application objects are identified. A\\nsource object (e.g., a report icon) is dragged and dropped onto a target object (e.g., a\\nprinter icon). The implication of this action is to create a hard-copy report. An\\napplication object represents application-specific data that are not directly manipu-\\nlated as part of screen interaction. For example, a mailing list is used to store names\\nfor a mailing. The list itself might be sorted, merged, or purged (menu-based ac-\\ntions), but it is not dragged and dropped via user interaction.\\nWhen you are satisfied that all important objects and actions have been de-\\nfined (for one design iteration), screen layout is performed. Like other interface\\ndesign activities, screen layout is an interactive process in which graphical de-\\nsign and placement of icons, definition of descriptive screen text, specification\\nand titling for windows, and definition of major and minor menu items are con-\\nducted. If a real-world metaphor is appropriate for the application, it is specified\\nat this time, and the layout is organized in a manner that complements the\\nmetaphor.\\nTo provide a brief illustration of the design steps noted previously, consider a user\\nscenario for the SafeHome system (discussed in earlier chapters). A preliminary use\\ncase (written by the homeowner) for the interface follows:\\nPreliminary use case: I want to gain access to my SafeHome system from any remote\\nlocation via the Internet. Using browser software operating on my notebook computer\\n(while I’m at work or traveling), I can determine the status of the alarm system, arm or\\ndisarm the system, reconfigure security zones, and view different rooms within the house\\nvia preinstalled video cameras.\\nTo access SafeHome from a remote location, I provide an identifier and a password.\\nThese define levels of access (e.g., all users may not be able to reconfigure the system) and\\nprovide security. Once validated, I can check the status of the system and change the sta-\\ntus by arming or disarming SafeHome. I can reconfigure the system by displaying a floor\\nplan of the house, viewing each of the security sensors, displaying each currently config-\\nured zone, and modifying zones as required. I can view the interior of the house via strate-\\ngically placed video cameras. I can pan and zoom each camera to provide different views\\nof the interior.\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:56 PM  Page 329'),\n",

Unfortunately, many designers do not address these issues until\\nrelatively late in the design process (sometimes the first inkling of a problem doesn’t\\noccur until an operational prototype is available). Unnecessary iteration, project\\ndelays, and end-user frustration often result. It is far better to establish each as a\\ndesign issue to be considered at the beginning of software design, when changes are\\neasy and costs are low.\\nResponse time. System response time is the primary complaint for many interac-\\ntive applications. In general, system response time is measured from the point at\\nwhich the user performs some control action (e.g., hits the return key or clicks a\\nmouse) until the software responds with desired output or action.\\nSystem response time has two important characteristics: length and variability.\\nIf system response is too long, user frustration and stress are inevitable. Variability\\nrefers to the deviation from average response time, and in many ways, it is the\\nmost important response time characteristic. Low variability enables the user to\\nestablish an interaction rhythm, even if response time is relatively long. For ex-\\nample, a 1-second response to a command will often be preferable to a response\\nthat varies from 0.1 to 2.5 seconds. When variability is significant, the user is al-\\nways off balance, always wondering whether something “different” has occurred\\nbehind the scenes.\\nHelp facilities. Almost every user of an interactive, computer-based system re-\\nquires help now and then. In some cases, a simple question addressed to a knowl-\\nedgeable colleague can do the trick. In others, detailed research in a multivolume set\\nof “user manuals” may be the only option. In most cases, however, modern software\\nprovides online help facilities that enable a user to get a question answered or\\nresolve a problem without leaving the interface.\\nA number of design issues [Rub88] must be addressed when a help facility is con-\\nsidered:\\n• Will help be available for all system functions and at all times during system\\ninteraction? Options include help for only a subset of all functions and\\nactions or help for all functions.\\n• How will the user request help? Options include a help menu, a special\\nfunction key, or a HELP command.\\n• How will help be represented? Options include a separate window, a\\nreference to a printed document (less than ideal), or a one- or two-line\\nsuggestion produced in a fixed screen location.\\n• How will the user return to normal interaction? Options include a\\nreturn button displayed on the screen, a function key, or control \\nsequence.\\nuote:\\n“A common\\nmistake that\\npeople make when\\ntrying to design\\nsomething\\ncompletely\\nfoolproof is to\\nunderestimate the\\ningenuity of\\ncomplete fools.”\\nDouglas Adams\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:56 PM  Page 332'),\n",

Options include a “flat” structure in\\nwhich all information is accessed through a keyword, a layered hierarchy of\\ninformation that provides increasing detail as the user proceeds into the\\nstructure, or the use of hypertext.\\nError handling. Error messages and warnings are “bad news” delivered to users\\nof interactive systems when something has gone awry. At their worst, error\\nmessages and warnings impart useless or misleading information and serve only to\\nincrease user frustration. There are few computer users who have not encountered\\nan error of the form: “Application XXX has been forced to quit because an error of type\\n1023 has been encountered.” Somewhere, an explanation for error 1023 must exist;\\notherwise, why would the designers have added the identification? Yet, the error\\nmessage provides no real indication of what went wrong or where to look to get\\nadditional information. An error message presented in this manner does nothing to\\nassuage user anxiety or to help correct the problem.\\nIn general, every error message or warning produced by an interactive system\\nshould have the following characteristics:\\n• The message should describe the problem in jargon that the user can\\nunderstand.\\n• The message should provide constructive advice for recovering from the\\nerror.\\n• The message should indicate any negative consequences of the error (e.g.,\\npotentially corrupted data files) so that the user can check to ensure that they\\nhave not occurred (or correct them if they have).\\n• The message should be accompanied by an audible or visual cue. That is, a\\nbeep might be generated to accompany the display of the message, or the\\nmessage might flash momentarily or be displayed in a color that is easily\\nrecognizable as the “error color.”\\n• The message should be “nonjudgmental.” That is, the wording should never\\nplace blame on the user.\\nBecause no one really likes bad news, few users will like an error message no mat-\\nter how well designed. But an effective error message philosophy can do much to\\nimprove the quality of an interactive system and will significantly reduce user frus-\\ntration when problems do occur.\\nMenu and command labeling. The typed command was once the most com-\\nmon mode of interaction between user and system software and was commonly\\nused for applications of every type. Today, the use of window-oriented, point-and-\\npick interfaces has reduced reliance on typed commands, but some power-users\\ncontinue to prefer a command-oriented mode of interaction.

What can be\\ndone if a command is forgotten?\\n• Can commands be customized or abbreviated by the user?\\n• Are menu labels self-explanatory within the context of the interface?\\n• Are submenus consistent with the function implied by a master menu item?\\nAs I noted earlier in this chapter, conventions for command usage should be es-\\ntablished across all applications. It is confusing and often error-prone for a user\\nto type alt-D when a graphics object is to be duplicated in one application and \\nalt-D when a graphics object is to be deleted in another. The potential for error is\\nobvious.\\nApplication accessibility. As computing applications become ubiquitous, soft-\\nware engineers must ensure that interface design encompasses mechanisms that\\nenable easy access for those with special needs. Accessibilityfor users (and software\\nengineers) who may be physically challenged is an imperative for ethical, legal, and\\nbusiness reasons. A variety of accessibility guidelines (e.g., [W3C03])—many de-\\nsigned for Web applications but often applicable to all types of software—provide de-\\ntailed suggestions for designing interfaces that achieve varying levels of accessibility.\\nOthers (e.g., [App08], [Mic08]) provide specific guidelines for “assistive technology”\\nthat addresses the needs of those with visual, hearing, mobility, speech, and learn-\\ning impairments.\\nInternationalization. Software engineers and their managers invariably underes-\\ntimate the effort and skills required to create user interfaces that accommodate the\\nneeds of different locales and languages. Too often, interfaces are designed for one\\nlocale and language and then jury-rigged to work in other countries. The challenge\\nfor interface designers is to create “globalized” software. That is, user interfaces\\nshould be designed to accommodate a generic core of functionality that can be de-\\nlivered to all who use the software. Localization features enable the interface to be\\ncustomized for a specific market.\\nA variety of internationalization guidelines (e.g., [IBM03]) are available to soft-\\nware engineers. These guidelines address broad design issues (e.g., screen layouts\\nmay differ in various markets) and discrete implementation issues (e.g., different\\nalphabets may create specialized labeling and spacing requirements). The Unicode\\nstandard [Uni03] has been developed to address the daunting challenge of manag-\\ning dozens of natural languages with hundreds of characters and symbols.\\nWebRef\\nGuidelines for\\ndeveloping accessible\\nsoftware can be\\nfound at \\nwww3.ibm.com/\\nable/guidelines/\\nsoftware/\\naccesssoftware\\n.html.\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:56 PM  Page 334'),\n",

Because of the sheer\\nvolume of competing WebApps in virtually every subject area, the interface must\\n“grab” a potential user immediately.\\nBruce Tognozzi [Tog01] defines a set of fundamental characteristics that all\\ninterfaces should exhibit and in doing so, establishes a philosophy that should be\\nfollowed by every WebApp interface designer:\\nEffective interfaces are visually apparent and forgiving, instilling in their users a sense of\\ncontrol. Users quickly see the breadth of their options, grasp how to achieve their goals,\\nand do their work.\\nEffective interfaces do not concern the user with the inner workings of the system.\\nWork is carefully and continuously saved, with full option for the user to undo any activ-\\nity at any time.\\nEffective applications and services perform a maximum of work, while requiring a\\nminimum of information from users.\\nIn order to design WebApp interfaces that exhibit these characteristics, Tognozzi\\n[Tog01] identifies a set of overriding design principles:9\\nAnticipation. A WebApp should be designed so that it anticipates the user’s next\\nmove. For example, consider a customer support WebApp developed by a manufac-\\nturer of computer printers. A user has requested a content object that presents\\ninformation about a printer driver for a newly released operating system. The\\ndesigner of the WebApp should anticipate that the user might request a download\\nof the driver and should provide navigation facilities that allow this to happen\\nwithout requiring the user to search for this capability.\\nCommunication. The interface should communicate the status of any activity initi-\\nated by the user.Communication can be obvious (e.g., a text message) or subtle (e.g.,\\nan image of a sheet of paper moving through a printer to indicate that printing is\\nunder way). The interface should also communicate user status (e.g., the user’s iden-\\ntification) and her location within the WebApp content hierarchy.\\nConsistency. The use of navigation controls, menus, icons, and aesthetics (e.g., color,\\nshape, layout) should be consistent throughout the WebApp.For example, if underlined\\nblue text implies a navigation link, content should never incorporate blue underlined\\ntext that does not imply a link. In addition, an object, say a yellow triangle, used to\\nA good WebApp\\ninterface is\\nunderstandable and\\nforgiving, providing the\\nuser with a sense of\\ncontrol.\\nIs there a set\\nof basic prin-\\nciples that can be\\napplied as you\\ndesign a GUI?\\n?\\n9 Tognozzi’s original principles have been adapted and extended for use this book.

The interface should facilitate user movement throughout\\nthe WebApp, but it should do so in a manner that enforces navigation conventions that\\nhave been established for the application. For example, navigation to secure portions\\nof the WebApp should be controlled by userID and password, and there should be no\\nnavigation mechanism that enables a user to circumvent these controls.\\nEfficiency. The design of the WebApp and its interface should optimize the user’s\\nwork efficiency, not the efficiency of the developer who designs and builds it or the client-\\nserver environment that executes it. Tognozzi [Tog01] discusses this when he writes:\\n“This simple truth is why it is so important for everyone involved in a software proj-\\nect to appreciate the importance of making user productivity goal one and to under-\\nstand the vital difference between building an efficient system and empowering\\nan efficient user.”\\nFlexibility. The interface should be flexible enough to enable some users to accomplish\\ntasks directly and others to explore the WebApp in a somewhat random fashion.In every\\ncase, it should enable the user to understand where he is and provide the user with\\nfunctionality that can undo mistakes and retrace poorly chosen navigation paths.\\nFocus. The WebApp interface (and the content it presents) should stay focused on the\\nuser task(s) at hand. In all hypermedia there is a tendency to route the user to loosely\\nrelated content. Why? Because it’s very easy to do! The problem is that the user can\\nrapidly become lost in many layers of supporting information and lose sight of the\\noriginal content that she wanted in the first place.\\nFitt’s law. “The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the\\ntarget” [Tog01]. Based on a study conducted in the 1950s [Fit54], Fitt’s law “is an\\neffective method of modeling rapid, aimed movements, where one appendage (like a\\nhand) starts at rest at a specific start position, and moves to rest within a target area”\\n[Zha02]. If a sequence of selections or standardized inputs (with many different\\noptions within the sequence) is defined by a user task, the first selection (e.g., mouse\\npick) should be physically close to the next selection.

There-\\nfore, the next choice is immediately obvious (it is nearby) and the time to acquire it\\nis negligible. If, on the other hand, the choice appeared on a menu that was located\\non the other side of the screen, the time for the user to acquire it (and then make the\\nchoice) would be far too long.\\nHuman interface objects. A vast library of reusable human interface objects has\\nbeen developed for WebApps. Use them.Any interface object that can be “seen, heard,\\ntouched or otherwise perceived” [Tog01] by an end user can be acquired from any\\none of a number of object libraries.\\nLatency reduction. Rather than making the user wait for some internal operation to\\ncomplete (e.g., downloading a complex graphical image), the WebApp should use mul-\\ntitasking in a way that lets the user proceed with work as if the operation has been com-\\npleted. In addition to reducing latency, delays must be acknowledged so that the user\\nunderstands what is happening. This includes (1) providing audio feedback when a\\nselection does not result in an immediate action by the WebApp, (2) displaying an\\nanimated clock or progress bar to indicate that processing is under way, and (3) pro-\\nviding some entertainment (e.g., an animation or text presentation) while lengthy\\nprocessing occurs.\\nLearnability. A WebApp interface should be designed to minimize learning time, and\\nonce learned, to minimize relearning required when the WebApp is revisited.In general\\nthe interface should emphasize a simple, intuitive design that organizes content and\\nfunctionality into categories that are obvious to the user.\\nMetaphors. An interface that uses an interaction metaphor is easier to learn and\\neasier to use, as long as the metaphor is appropriate for the application and the user. A\\nmetaphor should call on images and concepts from the user’s experience, but it does\\nnot need to be an exact reproduction of a real-world experience. For example, an \\ne-commerce site that implements automated bill paying for a financial institution,\\nuses a checkbook metaphor (not surprisingly) to assist the user in specifying and\\nscheduling bill payments. However, when a user “writes” a check, he need not enter\\nthe complete payee name but can pick from a list of payees or have the system select\\nbased on the first few typed letters. The metaphor remains intact, but the user gets\\nan assist from the WebApp.\\nMaintain work product integrity. A work product (e.g., a form completed by the\\nuser, a user-specified list) must be automatically saved so that it will not be lost if an error\\noccurs. Each of us has experienced the frustration associated with completing a\\nlengthy WebApp form only to have the content lost because of an error (made by us,\\nby the WebApp, or in transmission from client to server). To avoid this, a WebApp\\nshould be designed to autosave all user-specified data. The interface should support\\nthis function and provide the user with an easy mechanism for recovering “lost”\\ninformation.\\nMetaphors are an\\nexcellent idea because\\nthey mirror real-world\\nexperience. Just be\\nsure that the metaphor\\nyou choose is well\\nknown to end users.\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:56 PM  Page 338'),\n",

All information presented through the interface should be readable by\\nyoung and old. The interface designer should emphasize readable type styles, font\\nsizes, and color background choices that enhance contrast.\\nTrack state. When appropriate, the state of the user interaction should be tracked and\\nstored so that a user can logoff and return later to pick up where she left off.In general,\\ncookies can be designed to store state information.

Therefore, do not force the user to read\\nvoluminous amounts of text, particularly when the text explains the\\noperation of the WebApp or assists in navigation.\\n• Avoid “under construction” signs—an unnecessary link is sure to disappoint.\\n• Users prefer not to scroll. Important information should be placed within the\\ndimensions of a typical browser window.\\n• Navigation menus and head bars should be designed consistently and should\\nbe available on all pages that are available to the user. The design should not\\nrely on browser functions to assist in navigation.\\n• Aesthetics should never supersede functionality. For example, a simple\\nbutton might be a better navigation option than an aesthetically pleasing, but\\nvague image or icon whose intent is unclear.\\n• Navigation options should be obvious, even to the casual user. The user\\nshould not have to search the screen to determine how to link to other\\ncontent or services.\\nA well-designed interface improves the user’s perception of the content or services\\nprovided by the site. It need not necessarily be flashy, but it should always be well\\nstructured and ergonomically sound.\\n11.5.2 Interface Design Workflow for WebApps\\nEarlier in this chapter I noted that user interface design begins with the identification\\nof user, task, and environmental requirements. Once user tasks have been identified,\\nuser scenarios (use cases) are created and analyzed to define a set of interface\\nobjects and actions.\\nInformation contained within the requirements model forms the basis for the\\ncreation of a screen layout that depicts graphical design and placement of icons, def-\\ninition of descriptive screen text, specification and titling for windows, and specifi-\\ncation of major and minor menu items. Tools are then used to prototype and\\nultimately implement the interface design model. The following tasks represent a\\nrudimentary workflow for WebApp interface design:\\n1. Review information contained in the requirements model and refine\\nas required.\\n2. Develop a rough sketch of the WebApp interface layout.An interface\\nprototype (including the layout) may have been developed as part of the\\nrequirements modeling activity.

Define a set of user tasks that are associated with each action. Each\\ninterface action (e.g., “buy a product”) is associated with a set of user tasks.\\nThese tasks have been identified during requirements modeling.

Evaluation can span a formal-\\nity spectrum that ranges from an informal “test drive,” in which a user provides\\nimpromptu feedback to a formally designed study that uses statistical methods for\\nthe evaluation of questionnaires completed by a population of end users.\\nThe user interface evaluation cycle takes the form shown in Figure 11.5. After the\\ndesign model has been completed, a first-level prototype is created. The prototype is\\nevaluated by the user,\\n11 who provides you with direct comments about the efficacy\\nof the interface. In addition, if formal evaluation techniques are used (e.g., ques-\\ntionnaires, rating sheets), you can extract information from these data (e.g., \\n80 percent of all users did not like the mechanism for saving data files). Design mod-\\nifications are made based on user input, and the next level prototype is created. The\\nevaluation cycle continues until no further modifications to the interface design are\\nnecessary.\\n11 It is important to note that experts in ergonomics and interface design may also conduct reviews\\nof the interface. These reviews are called heuristic evaluations or cognitive walkthroughs.\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:56 PM  Page 342'),\n",

If the interface is poorly designed, the user’s ability to tap the com-\\nputational power and informational content of an application may be severely\\nhindered. In fact, a weak interface may cause an otherwise well-designed and solidly\\nimplemented application to fail.\\nThree important principles guide the design of effective user interfaces: (1) place\\nthe user in control, (2) reduce the user’s memory load, and (3) make the interface con-\\nsistent. To achieve an interface that abides by these principles, an organized design\\nprocess must be conducted.\\nThe development of a user interface begins with a series of analysis tasks. User\\nanalysis defines the profiles of various end users and is gathered from a variety of\\nbusiness and technical sources. Task analysis defines user tasks and actions using\\neither an elaborative or object-oriented approach, applying use cases, task and ob-\\nject elaboration, workflow analysis, and hierarchical task representations to fully\\nunderstand the human-computer interaction. Environmental analysis identifies the\\nphysical and social structures in which the interface must operate.\\nOnce tasks have been identified, user scenarios are created and analyzed to define\\na set of interface objects and actions. This provides a basis for the creation of a screen\\nlayout that depicts graphical design and placement of icons, definition of descriptive\\nscreen text, specification and titling for windows, and specification of major and minor\\nmenu items. Design issues such as response time, command and action structure, er-\\nror handling, and help facilities are considered as the design model is refined. A variety\\nof implementation tools are used to build a prototype for evaluation by the user.\\nLike interface design for conventional software, the design of WebApp interfaces\\ndescribes the structure and organization of the user interface and includes a repre-\\nsentation of screen layout, a definition of the modes of interaction, and a description\\nof navigation mechanisms. A set of interface design principles and an interface de-\\nsign workflow guide a WebApp designer when layout and interface control mecha-\\nnisms are designed.\\npre75977_ch11.qxd  11/27/08  3:56 PM  Page 344'),\n",

Pattern-based design\\ncreates a new application by finding\\na set of proven solutions to a clearly\\ndelineated set of problems. Each\\nproblem and its solution is described by a design\\npattern that has been cataloged and vetted by\\nother software engineers who have encountered\\nthe problem and implemented the solution while\\ndesigning other applications. Each design pat-\\ntern provides you with a proven approach to\\none part of the problem to be solved.\\nWho does it? A software engineer examines each\\nproblem encountered for a new application and\\nthen attempts to find a relevant solution by\\nsearching one or more patterns repositories.\\nWhy is it important? Have you ever heard the\\nphrase “reinventing the wheel”? It happens all\\nthe time in software development, and it’s a\\nwaste of time and energy. By using existing\\ndesign patterns, you can acquire a proven solu-\\ntion for a specific problem. As each pattern is\\napplied, solutions are integrated and the appli-\\ncation to be built moves closer to a complete\\ndesign.\\nQUICK\\nLOOK\\nWhat are the steps? The requirements model is\\nexamined in order to isolate the hierarchical set\\nof problems to be solved. The problem space is\\npartitioned so that subsets of problems associ-\\nated with specific software functions and fea-\\ntures can be identified. Problems can also be\\norganized by type: architectural, component-\\nlevel, algorithmic, user interface, etc. Once a\\nsubset of problems is defined, one or more pat-\\ntern repositories are searched to determine if an\\nexisting design pattern, represented at an ap-\\npropriate level of abstraction, exists. Patterns\\nthat are applicable are adapted to the specific\\nneeds of the software to be built. Custom prob-\\nlem solving is applied in situations for which no\\npatterns can be found.\\nWhat is the work product? A design model that\\ndepicts the architectural structure, user interface,\\nand component-level detail is developed.\\nHow do I ensure that I’ve done it right?As each\\ndesign pattern is translated into some element of\\nthe design model, work products are reviewed for\\nclarity, correctness, completeness, and consis-\\ntency with requirements and with one another.\\nKEY\\nCONCEPTS\\ndesign \\nmistakes  . . . . .359\\nforces  . . . . . . .349\\nframeworks  . . .352\\ngranularity . . . .369\\npattern\\nlanguages  . . . .353\\npatterns\\narchitectural  . .360\\nbehavioral  . . .351\\npre75977_ch12.qxd  11/27/08  3:58 PM  Page 347'),\n",

He characterized\\nthese recurring problems and their solutions as patterns, describing them in the\\nfollowing manner [Ale77]:\\nEach pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment and\\nthen describes the core of the solution to that problem in such a way that you can use the\\nsolution a million times over without ever doing it the same way twice.\\nAlexander’s ideas were first translated into the software world in books by Gamma\\n[Gam95], Buschmann [Bus96], and their many colleagues.1 Today, dozens of pattern\\nrepositories exist, and pattern-based design can be applied in many different appli-\\ncation domains.\\n348 PART TWO MODELING\\ncomponent-\\nlevel  . . . . . . .362\\ngenerative  . . .350\\ncreational . . . .350\\nstructural  . . . .351\\nuser\\ninterface  . . . .366\\nWebApps  . . . .368\\n12.1 D ESIGN PATTERNS\\nA design pattern can be characterized as “a three-part rule which expresses a rela-\\ntion between a certain context, a problem, and a solution” [Ale79]. For software\\ndesign, context allows the reader to understand the environment in which the prob-\\nlem resides and what solution might be appropriate within that environment. A set\\nof requirements, including limitations and constraints, acts as a system of forcesthat\\ninfluences how the problem can be interpreted within its context and how the solu-\\ntion can be effectively applied.\\nTo better understand these concepts, consider a situation\\n2 in which a person must\\ntravel between New York and Los Angeles. In this context, travel will occur within\\nan industrialized country (the United States), using an existing transportation infra-\\nstructure (e.g., roads, airlines, railways). The system of forces that will affect the way\\nin which the travel problem is solved will include: how quickly the person wants to\\nget from New York to LA, whether the trip will include site-seeing or stopovers, how\\nmuch money the person can spend, whether the trip is intended to accomplish a spe-\\ncific purpose, and the personal vehicles the person has at her disposal. Given these\\nforces, the problem (traveling from New York to LA) can be better defined. For\\nexample, investigation (requirements gathering) indicates that the person has very\\nlittle money, owns only a bicycle (and is an avid cyclist), wants to make the trip to\\nraise money for her favorite charity, and has plenty of time to spare. The solution to\\nthe problem, given the context and the system of forces, might be a cross-country\\n1 Earlier discussions of software patterns do exist, but these two classic books were the first cohesive\\ntreatments of the subject.\\n2 This example has been adapted from [Cor98].\\nForces are those\\ncharacteristics of the\\nproblem and attributes\\nof the solution that\\nconstrain the way in\\nwhich the design can\\nbe developed.\\npre75977_ch12.qxd  11/27/08  3:58 PM  Page 348'),\n",

If the forces were different (e.g., travel time must be minimized and the pur-\\npose of the trip is a business meeting), another solution might be more appropriate.\\nIt is reasonable to argue that most problems have multiple solutions, but that a\\nsolution is effective only if it is appropriate within the context of the existing prob-\\nlem. It is the system of forces that causes a designer to choose a specific solution.\\nThe intent is to provide a solution that best satisfies the system of forces, even when\\nthese forces are contradictory. Finally, every solution has consequences that may\\nhave an impact on other aspects of the software and may themselves become part\\nof the system of forces for other problems to be solved within the larger system.\\nCoplien [Cop05] characterizes an effective design pattern in the following way:\\n• It solves a problem: Patterns capture solutions, not just abstract principles or\\nstrategies.\\n• It is a proven concept: Patterns capture solutions with a track record, not theo-\\nries or speculation.\\n• The solution isn’t obvious: Many problem-solving techniques (such as software\\ndesign paradigms or methods) try to derive solutions from first principles. The\\nbest patterns generate a solution to a problem indirectly—a necessary approach\\nfor the most difficult problems of design.\\n• It describes a relationship: Patterns don’t just describe modules, but describe\\ndeeper system structures and mechanisms.\\n• The pattern has a significant human component (minimize human intervention).\\nAll software serves human comfort or quality of life; the best patterns explicitly\\nappeal to aesthetics and utility.\\nStated even more pragmatically, a good design pattern captures hard-earned, prag-\\nmatic design knowledge in a way that enables others to reuse that knowledge “a mil-\\nlion times over without ever doing it the same way twice.” A design pattern saves you\\nfrom “reinventing the wheel,” or worse, inventing a “new wheel” that is slightly out of\\nround, too small for its intended use, and too narrow for the ground it will roll over. De-\\nsign patterns, if used effectively, will invariably make you a better software designer.\\n12.1.1 Kinds of Patterns\\nOne of the reasons that software engineers are interested in (and intrigued by)\\ndesign patterns is that human beings are inherently good at pattern recognition. If\\nwe weren’t, we’d be frozen in space and time—unable to learn from past experience,\\nunwilling to venture forward because of our inability to recognize situations that\\nmight lead to high risk, unhinged by a world that seems to have no regularity or log-\\nical consistency. Luckily, none of this occurs because we do recognize patterns in\\nvirtually every aspect of our lives.\\nIn the real world, the patterns we recognize are learned over a lifetime of experi-\\nence. We recognize them instantly and inherently understand what they mean\\nand how they might be used. Some of these patterns provide us with insight into\\nCHAPTER 12 PATTERN-BASED DESIGN 349\\nuote:\\n“Our responsibility\\nis to do what we\\ncan, learn what we\\ncan, improve the\\nsolutions, and pass\\nthem on.”\\nRichard P .\\nFeynman\\npre75977_ch12.qxd  11/27/08  3:58 PM  Page 349'),\n",

You’re 4 miles from\\nthe accident, but already you begin to see traffic slowing, recognizing a pattern that\\nwe’ll call RubberNecking. People in the travel lanes moving in your direction are\\nslowing at the sight of the accident to get a better view of what happened on the\\nopposite side of the highway. The RubberNecking pattern yields remarkably pre-\\ndictable results (a traffic jam), but it does nothing more than describe a phenome-\\nnon. In patterns jargon, it might be called a nongenerative pattern because it\\ndescribes a context and a problem but it does not provide any clear-cut solution.\\nWhen software design patterns are considered, we strive to identify and document\\ngenerative patterns. That is, we identify a pattern that describes an important and\\nrepeatable aspect of a system and that provides us with a way to build that aspect\\nwithin a system of forces that are unique to a given context. In an ideal setting, a col-\\nlection of generative design patterns could be used to “generate” an application or\\ncomputer-based system whose architecture enables it to adapt to change. Some-\\ntimes called generativity, “the successive application of several patterns, each encap-\\nsulating its own problem and forces, unfolds a larger solution which emerges\\nindirectly as a result of the smaller solutions” [App00].\\nDesign patterns span a broad spectrum of abstraction and application.\\nArchitectural patterns describe broad-based design problems that are solved using a\\nstructural approach. Data patternsdescribe recurring data-oriented problems and the\\ndata modeling solutions that can be used to solve them. Component patterns (also\\nreferred to as design patterns) address problems associated with the development of\\nsubsystems and components, the manner in which they communicate with one\\nanother, and their placement within a larger architecture. Interface design patterns\\ndescribe common user interface problems and their solution with a system of forces\\nthat includes the specific characteristics of end users.

In some\\ncases it may be necessary to provide an implementation-specific skeletal infrastruc-\\nture, called a framework, for design work. That is, you can select a “reusable mini-\\narchitecture that provides the generic structure and behavior for a family of software\\nabstractions, along with a context . . . which specifies their collaboration and use\\nwithin a given domain” [Amb98].\\nA framework is not an architectural pattern, but rather a skeleton with a collec-\\ntion of “plug points” (also called hooksand slots) that enable it to be adapted to a spe-\\ncific problem domain. The plug points enable you to integrate problem-specific\\nclasses or functionality within the skeleton. In an object-oriented context, a frame-\\nwork is a collection of cooperating classes.\\nGamma and his colleagues [Gam95] describe the differences between design\\npatterns and frameworks in the following manner:\\n1. Design patterns are more abstract than frameworks. Frameworks can be embodied\\nin code, but only examples of patterns can be embodied in code. A strength of\\nframeworks is that they can be written down in programming languages and not\\nonly studied but executed and reused directly....\\n2. Design patterns are smaller architectural elements than frameworks. A typical\\nframework contains several design patterns but the reverse is never true.\\n3. Design patterns are less specialized than frameworks. Frameworks always have a\\nparticular application domain. In contrast, design patterns can be used in nearly any\\nkind of application. While more specialized design patterns are certainly possible,\\neven these wouldn’t dictate an application architecture.\\nIn essence, the designer of a framework will argue that one reusable mini-\\narchitecture is applicable to all software to be developed within a limited domain of\\napplication. To be most effective, frameworks are applied with no changes. Addi-\\ntional design elements may be added, but only via the plug points that allow the\\ndesigner to flesh out the framework skeleton.\\n12.1.3 Describing a Pattern\\nPattern-based design begins with the recognition of patterns within the application\\nyou intend to build, continues with a search to determine whether others have\\naddressed the pattern, and concludes with the application of an appropriate pattern\\nto the problem at hand. The second of these three tasks is often the most difficult.\\nHow do you find patterns that fit your needs?\\nAn answer to this question must rely on effective communication of the problem\\nthe pattern addresses, the context in which the pattern resides, the system of forces\\nthat mold the context, and the solution that is proposed.

In both cases the language has a syntax and semantics that are used to com-\\nmunicate ideas or procedural instructions in an effective manner.\\nWhen the term language is used in the context of design patterns, it takes on a\\nslightly different meaning.

In a software context, broad design problems tend to be archi-\\ntectural in nature and address the overall structure of the application and the data or\\ncontent that serve it.

Applying pattern-\\nbased design to software development promises the same benefits to software as it does\\nto industrial technology: predictability, risk mitigation, and increased productivity.\\nThroughout the design process, you should look for every opportunity to apply\\nexisting design patterns (when they meet the needs of the design) rather than creat-\\ning new ones.\\n12.2.1 Pattern-Based Design in Context\\nPattern-based design is not used in a vacuum. The concepts and techniques dis-\\ncussed for architectural, component-level, and user interface design (Chapters 9\\nthrough 11) are all used in conjunction with a pattern-based approach.\\nIn Chapter 8, I noted that a set of quality guidelines and attributes serve as the\\nbasis for all software design decisions. The decisions themselves are influenced by\\na set of fundamental design concepts (e.g., separation of concerns, stepwise refine-\\nment, functional independence) that are achieved using heuristics that have evolved\\nover many decades, and best practices (e.g., techniques, modeling notation) that\\n354 PART TWO MODELING\\nWebRef\\nFor a listing of useful\\npatterns languages\\nsee c2.com/ppr/\\ntitles.html.\\nAdditional information\\ncan be obtained at\\nhillside.net/\\npatterns/.\\nIf you can’t find a\\npattern language that\\naddresses your\\nproblem domain, look\\nfor analogies in\\nanother set of\\npatterns.\\npre75977_ch12.qxd  11/27/08  3:58 PM  Page 354'),\n",

A soft-\\nware designer begins with a requirements model (either explicit or implied) that\\npresents an abstract representation of the system. The requirements model describes\\nthe problem set, establishes the context, and identifies the system of forces that hold\\nsway. It may imply the design in an abstract manner, but the requirements model\\ndoes little to represent the design explicitly.\\nAs you begin your work as a designer, it’s always important to keep quality\\nattributes in mind. These attributes (e.g., a design must implement all explicit require-\\nments addressed in the requirements model) establish a way to assess software qual-\\nity but do little to help you actually achieve it. The design you create should exhibit\\nthe fundamental design concepts discussed in Chapter 8. Therefore, you should ap-\\nply proven techniques for translating the abstractions contained in the requirements\\nmodel into a more concrete form that is the software design. To accomplish this,\\nyou’ll use the methods and modeling tools available for architectural, component-\\nlevel, and interface design. But only when you’re faced with a problem, context, and\\nsystem of forces that have not been solved before.

And when I did so, I heard [Christopher]\\nAlexander say that “good software design cannot be achieved simply by adding together\\nperforming parts.”\\nGood design begins by considering context—the big picture. As context is evaluated,\\nyou extract a hierarchy of problems that must be solved. Some of these problems will\\nbe global in nature, while others will address specific features and functions of the\\nsoftware. All will be affected by a system of forces that will influence the nature of\\nthe solution that is proposed.\\nShalloway and Trott [Sha05] suggest the following approach\\n6 that enables a\\ndesigner to think in patterns:\\n1. Be sure you understand the big picture—the context in which the software to\\nbe built resides. The requirements model should communicate this to you.\\n2. Examining the big picture, extract the patterns that are present at that level\\nof abstraction.\\n3. Begin your design with “big picture” patterns that establish a context or\\nskeleton for further design work.\\n4. “Work inward from the context” [Sha05] looking for patterns at lower levels\\nof abstraction that contribute to the design solution.\\n5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 until the complete design is fleshed out.\\n6. Refine the design by adapting each pattern to the specifics of the software\\nyou’re trying to build.\\nIt’s important to note that patterns are not independent entities. Design patterns that\\nare present at a high level of abstraction will invariably influence the manner in\\nwhich other patterns are applied at lower levels of abstraction. In addition, patterns\\noften collaborate with one another. The implication—when you select an architec-\\ntural pattern, it may very well influence the component-level design patterns you\\nchoose. Likewise, when you select a specific interface design pattern, you are some-\\ntimes forced to use other patterns that collaborate with it.\\nTo illustrate, consider the SafeHomeAssured.com WebApp. If you consider the\\nbig picture, the WebApp must address a number of fundamental problems such as:\\n• How to provide information about SafeHome products and services\\n• How to sell SafeHome products and services to customers\\n• How to establish Internet-based monitoring and control of an installed\\nsecurity system\\n356 PART TWO MODELING\\nPattern-\\nbased design\\nlooks interesting\\nfor the problem\\nI have to solve.\\nHow do I get\\nstarted?\\n?\\n6 Based on the work of Christopher Alexander [Ale79].\\npre75977_ch12.qxd  11/27/08  3:58 PM  Page 356'),\n",

The \\nE-commerce pattern (likely, an architectural pattern) implies mechanisms for\\nsetting up a customer account, displaying the products to be sold, selecting prod-\\nucts for purchase, and so forth. Hence, if you think in patterns, it is important to\\ndetermine whether a pattern for setting up an account exists. If SetUpAccount\\nis available as a viable pattern for the problem context, it may collaborate with\\nother patterns such as BuildInputForm, ManageFormsInput, and Validate-\\nFormsEntry. Each of these patterns delineates problems to be solved and solu-\\ntions that may be applied.\\n12.2.3 Design Tasks\\nThe following design tasks are applied when a pattern-based design philosophy is\\nused:\\n1. Examine the requirements model and develop a problem hierarchy.\\nDescribe each problem and subproblem by isolating the problem, the\\ncontext, and the system of forces that apply. Work from broad problems (high\\nlevel of abstraction) to smaller subproblems (at lower levels of abstraction).\\n2. Determine if a reliable pattern language has been developed for the\\nproblem domain. As I noted in Section 12.1.4, a pattern language addresses\\nproblems associated with a specific application domain. The SafeHome\\nsoftware team would look for a pattern language developed specifically for\\nhome security products. If that level of pattern language specificity could not\\nbe found, the team would partition the SafeHome software problem into a\\nseries of generic problem domains (e.g., digital device monitoring problems,\\nuser interface problems, digital video management problems) and search for\\nappropriate pattern languages.\\n3. Beginning with a broad problem, determine whether one or more\\narchitectural patterns is available for it. If an architectural pattern is\\navailable, be certain to examine all collaborating patterns. If the pattern is\\nappropriate, adapt the design solution proposed and build a design model\\nelement that adequately represents it. As I noted in Section 12.2.2, a broad\\nproblem for the SafeHomeAssured.com WebApp is addressed with an \\nE-commerce pattern. This pattern will suggest a specific architecture for\\naddressing e-commerce requirements.\\n4. Using the collaborations provided for the architectural pattern,\\nexamine subsystem or component-level problems and search for\\nappropriate patterns to address them. It may be necessary to search\\nthrough other pattern repositories as well as the list of patterns that corre-\\nsponds to the architectural solution.

If user interface design problems have been isolated (this is almost\\nalways the case), search the many user interface design pattern\\nrepositories for appropriate patterns. Proceed in a manner similar to\\nsteps 3, 4, and 5.\\n7.

Be certain to refine the design as it is derived from patterns using\\ndesign quality criteria as a guide.\\nAlthough this design approach is top-down, real-life design solutions are sometimes\\nmore complex. Gillis [Gil06] comments on this when he writes:\\nDesign patterns in software engineering are meant to be used in a deductive, rationalis-\\ntic fashion. So you have this general problem or requirement, X, design pattern Y solves\\nX, therefore use Y. Now, when I reflect on my own process—and I’ve got reason to believe\\nthat I’m not alone here—I find that it’s more organic than that, more inductive than\\ndeductive, more bottom-up than top-down.\\nObviously, there’s a balance to be achieved. When a project is in the initial bootstrap\\nphase and I’m trying to make the jump from abstract requirements to a concrete design\\nsolution, I’ll often perform a sort of breadth-first search . . . I’ve found design patterns to\\nbe helpful, allowing me to quickly frame up the design problem in concrete terms.\\nIn addition, the pattern-based approach must be used in conjunction with other soft-\\nware design concepts and techniques.\\n12.2.4 Building a Pattern-Organizing Table\\nAs pattern-based design proceeds, you may encounter trouble organizing and\\ncategorizing candidate patterns from multiple pattern languages and repositories.\\nTo help organize your evaluation of candidate patterns, Microsoft [Mic04] suggests\\nthe creation of a pattern-organizing table that takes the general form shown in\\nFigure 12.2.\\nA pattern-organizing table can be implemented as a spreadsheet model using the\\nform shown in the figure.

Like all design methods, you must begin with first principles, emphasizing\\nsoftware quality fundamentals and ensuring that the design does, in fact, address the\\nneeds expressed by the requirements model.\\nA number of common mistakes occur when pattern-based design is used. In some\\ncases, not enough time has been spent to understand the underlying problem and its\\ncontext and forces, and as a consequence, you select a pattern that looks right but\\nis inappropriate for the solution required. Once the wrong pattern is selected, you\\nrefuse to see your error and force-fit the pattern.

The review tech-\\nniques discussed in Chapter 15 can help to ensure that the pattern-based design you’ve\\ndeveloped will result in a high-quality solution for the software problem to be solved.\\n12.3 A RCHITECTURAL PATTERNS\\nIf a house builder decides to construct a center-hall colonial, there is a single archi-\\ntectural style that can be applied. The details of the style (e.g., number of fireplaces,\\nfaçade of the house, placement of doors and windows) can vary considerably, but once\\nthe decision on the overall architecture of the house is made, the style is imposed\\non the design.\\n7\\nArchitectural patterns are a bit different. For example, every house (and every\\narchitectural style for houses) employs a Kitchen pattern. The Kitchen pattern and\\npatterns it collaborates with address problems associated with the storage and\\npreparation of food, the tools required to accomplish these tasks, and rules for place-\\nment of these tools relative to workflow in the room. In addition, the pattern might\\naddress problems associated with countertops, lighting, wall switches, a central is-\\nland, flooring, and so on. Obviously, there is more than a single design for a kitchen,\\noften dictated by the context and system of forces. But every design can be conceived\\nwithin the context of the “solution” suggested by the Kitchenpattern.\\nAs I have already noted, architectural patterns for software define a specific\\napproach for handling some characteristic of the system. Bosch [Bos00] and Booch\\n[Boo08] define a number of architectural pattern domains. Representative examples\\nare provided in the paragraphs that follow:\\nAccess control. There are many situations in which access to data, features, and\\nfunctionality delivered by an application is limited to specifically defined end users.\\nFrom an architectural point of view, access to some portion of the software archi-\\ntecture must be controlled rigorously.\\nConcurrency. Many applications must handle multiple tasks in a manner that sim-\\nulates parallelism (i.e., this occurs whenever multiple “parallel” tasks or components\\nare managed by a single processor). There are a number of different ways in which\\nan application can handle concurrency, and each can be presented by a different\\narchitectural pattern. For example, one approach is to use an OperatingSystem-\\nProcessManagement pattern that provides built-in OS features that allow\\n360 PART TWO MODELING\\n7 This implies that there will be a central foyer and hallway, that rooms will be placed to the left and\\nright of the foyer, that the house will have two (or more) stories, that the bedrooms of the house\\nwill be upstairs, and so on.

The pattern also incorporates OS functionality\\nthat manages communication between processes, scheduling, and other capabilities\\nrequired to achieve concurrency. Another approach might be to define a task sched-\\nuler at the application level. A TaskScheduler pattern contains a set of active ob-\\njects that each contains a tick()operation [Bos00]. The scheduler periodically invokes\\ntick() for each object, which then performs the functions it must perform before re-\\nturning control back to the scheduler which then invokes the tick() operation for the\\nnext concurrent object.\\nDistribution. The distribution problem addresses the manner in which systems or\\ncomponents within systems communicate with one another in a distributed environ-\\nment. Two subproblems are considered: (1) the way in which entities connect to one\\nanother, and (2) the nature of the communication that occurs. The most common\\narchitectural pattern established to address the distribution problem is the Broker\\npattern. A broker acts as a “middleman” between the client component and a server com-\\nponent. The client sends a message to the broker (containing all appropriate information\\nfor the communication to be effected) and the broker completes the connection.\\nPersistence. Data persists if it survives past the execution of the process that created\\nit. Persistent data are stored in a database or file and may be read or modified by other\\nprocesses at a later time. In object-oriented environments, the idea of a persistent ob-\\nject extends the persistence concept a bit further. The values of all of the object’s at-\\ntributes, the general state of the object, and other supplementary information are stored\\nfor future retrieval and use. In general, two architectural patterns are used to achieve\\npersistence—a DatabaseManagementSystempattern that applies the storage and\\nretrieval capability of a DBMS to the application architecture or an Application Level-\\nPersistencepattern that builds persistence features into the application architecture\\n(e.g., word processing software that manages its own document structure).\\nBefore any one of the representative architectural patterns noted in the preceding\\nparagraphs can be chosen, it must be assessed for its appropriateness for the appli-\\ncation and the overall architectural style, as well as the context and system of forces\\nthat it specifies.\\nCHAPTER 12 PATTERN-BASED DESIGN 361\\nDesign Pattern Repositories\\nThere are many sources for design patterns avail-\\nable on the Web.

I’ve designed most of the capability\\nto connect to the actual sensors without too many problems.\\nI’ve also started thinking about the interface for the users to\\nactually move, pan, and zoom the cameras from a remote\\nWeb page, but I’m not sure I’ve got it right yet.\\nVinod: What have you come up with?\\nJamie: Well, the requirements are that the camera control\\nneeds to be highly interactive—as the user moves the control,\\nthe camera should move as soon as possible. So, I was\\nthinking of having a set of buttons laid out like a normal\\ncamera, but when the user clicks them, it controls the camera.\\nVinod: Hmmm. Yeah, that would work, but I’m not sure\\nit’s right—for each click of a control you need to wait for\\nthe whole client-server communication to occur, and so\\nyou won’t get a good sense of quick feedback.\\nJamie: That’s what I thought—and why I wasn’t very\\nhappy with the approach, but I’m not sure how else\\nI might do it.\\nVinod: Well, why not just use the\\nInteractiveDeviceControl pattern!\\nJamie: Uhmmm—what’s that? I haven’t heard of it?\\nVinod: It’s basically a pattern for exactly the problem\\nyou are describing. The solution it proposes is basically to\\ncreate a control connection to the server with the device,\\nthrough which control commands can be sent. That way\\nyou don’t need to send normal HTTP requests. And the\\npattern even shows how you can implement this using\\nsome simple AJAX techniques. You have some simple\\nclient-side JavaScript that communicates directly with the\\nserver and sends the commands as soon as the user does\\nanything.\\nJamie: Cool! That’s just what I needed to solve this\\nthing. Where do I find it?\\nVinod: It’s available in an online repository. Here’s\\nthe URL.\\nJamie: I’ll go check it out.\\nVinod: Yep—but remember to check the consequences\\nfield for the pattern. I seem to remember that there was\\nsomething in there about needing to be careful about\\nissues of security. I think it might be because you are\\ncreating a separate control channel and so bypassing the\\nnormal Web security mechanisms.\\nJamie: Good point. I probably wouldn’t have thought\\nof that!

When you consider the design prob-\\nlems that must be solved when a WebApp is to be built, it’s worth considering pat-\\ntern categories by focusing on two dimensions: the design focus of the pattern and\\nits level of granularity. Design focus identifies which aspect of the design model is\\nrelevant (e.g., information architecture, navigation, interaction). Granularity identi-\\nfies the level of abstraction that is being considered (e.g., does the pattern apply to\\nthe entire WebApp, to a single Web page, to a subsystem, or an individual WebApp\\ncomponent?).\\n12.6.1 Design Focus\\nIn earlier chapters I emphasized a design progression that begins by considering\\narchitecture, component-level issues, and user interface representations. At each\\nstep, the problems you consider and the solutions you propose begin at a high level\\nof abstraction and slowly become more detailed and specific. Stated another way,\\ndesign focus becomes “narrower” as you move further into design. The problems\\n(and solutions) you will encounter when designing an information architecture for a\\nWebApp are different from the problems (and solutions) that are encountered when\\nperforming interface design. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that patterns\\nfor WebApp design can be developed for different levels of design focus, so that you\\ncan address the unique problems (and related solutions) that are encountered at\\neach level. WebApp patterns can be categorized using the following levels of\\ndesign focus:\\n• Information architecture patterns relate to the overall structure of\\nthe information space, and the ways in which users will interact with the\\ninformation.\\n• Navigation patterns define navigation link structures, such as hierarchies,\\nrings, tours, and so on.\\n• Interaction patterns contribute to the design of the user interface. Patterns\\nin this category address how the interface informs the user of the conse-\\nquences of a specific action, how a user expands content based on usage\\n368 PART TWO MODELING\\nYour focus becomes\\n“narrower” the further\\nyou move into design.\\npre75977_ch12.qxd  11/27/08  3:58 PM  Page 368'),\n",

Patterns in this category address how to organize\\nuser interface control functions for better usability, how to show the relation-\\nship between an interface action and the content objects it affects, and how\\nto establish effective content hierarchies.\\n• Functional patterns define the workflows, behaviors, processing, commu-\\nnication, and other algorithmic elements within a WebApp.\\nIn most cases, it would be fruitless to explore the collection of information architec-\\nture patterns when a problem in interaction design is encountered. You would ex-\\namine interaction patterns, because that is the design focus that is relevant to the\\nwork being performed.\\n12.6.2 Design Granularity\\nWhen a problem involves “big picture” issues, you should attempt to develop\\nsolutions (and use relevant patterns) that focus on the big picture. Conversely, when\\nthe focus is very narrow (e.g., uniquely selecting one item from a small set of five or\\nfewer items), the solution (and the corresponding pattern) is targeted quite nar-\\nrowly. In terms of the level of granularity, patterns can be described at the follow-\\ning levels:\\n• Architectural patterns. This level of abstraction will typically relate to\\npatterns that define the overall structure of the WebApp, indicate the rela-\\ntionships among different components or increments, and define the rules\\nfor specifying relationships among the elements (pages, packages, compo-\\nnents, subsystems) of the architecture.\\n• Design patterns. These address a specific element of the design such as\\nan aggregation of components to solve some design problem, relationships\\namong elements on a page, or the mechanisms for effecting component-to-\\ncomponent communication. An example might be the Broadsheet pattern\\nfor the layout of a WebApp home page.\\n• Component patterns. This level of abstraction relates to individual small-\\nscale elements of a WebApp. Examples include individual interaction\\nelements (e.g., radio buttons), navigation items (e.g., how might you format\\nlinks?) or functional elements (e.g., specific algorithms).\\nIt is also possible to define the relevance of different patterns to different classes\\nof applications or domains. For example, a collection of patterns (at different levels\\nof design focus and granularity) might be particularly relevant to e-business.\\nCHAPTER 12 PATTERN-BASED DESIGN 369\\npre75977_ch12.qxd  11/27/08  3:58 PM  Page 369'),\n",

A pattern describes a problem, indicates the context enabling\\nthe user to understand the environment in which the problem resides, and lists a sys-\\ntem of forces that indicate how the problem can be interpreted within its context and\\nhow the solution can be applied.

Design allows you to create\\na model that can be assessed for quality and\\nimproved before content and code are gener-\\nated, tests are conducted, and end users become\\ninvolved in large numbers.

WebApp design encom-\\npasses six major steps that are driven by informa-\\ntion obtained during requirements modeling.\\nContent design uses the content model (developed\\nduring analysis) as the basis for establishing\\nQUICK\\nLOOK\\nthe design of content objects. Aesthetic design\\n(also called graphic design) establishes the look\\nand feel that the end user sees.

The implication:\\nquality characteristics are universal for all software.\\n13.1 W EB APP DESIGN QUALITY\\nDesign is the engineering activity that leads to a high-quality product. This leads us\\nto a recurring question that is encountered in all engineering disciplines: What\\nis quality? In this section I’ll examine the answer within the context of WebApp\\ndevelopment.\\nEvery person who has surfed the Web or used a corporate Intranet has an opin-\\nion about what makes a “good” WebApp. Individual viewpoints vary widely. Some\\nusers enjoy flashy graphics; others want simple text. Some demand copious\\ninformation; others desire an abbreviated presentation. Some like sophisticated an-\\nalytical tools or database access; others like to keep it simple. In fact, the user’s per-\\nception of “goodness” (and the resultant acceptance or rejection of the WebApp as a\\nconsequence) might be more important than any technical discussion of WebApp\\nquality.\\nBut how is WebApp quality perceived? What attributes must be exhibited to\\nachieve goodness in the eyes of end users and at the same time exhibit the techni-\\ncal characteristics of quality that will enable you to correct, adapt, enhance, and sup-\\nport the application over the long term?\\nIn reality, all of the technical characteristics of design quality discussed in Chapter 8\\nand the generic quality attributes presented in Chapter 14 apply to WebApps. How-\\never, the most relevant of these generic attributes—usability, functionality, reliabil-\\nity, efficiency, and maintainability—provide a useful basis for assessing the quality of\\nWeb-based systems.\\nOlsina and his colleagues [Ols99] have prepared a “quality requirement tree” that\\nidentifies a set of technical attributes—usability, functionality, reliability, efficiency,\\nand maintainability—that lead to high-quality WebApps.\\n2 Figure 13.1 summarizes\\ntheir work. The criteria noted in the figure are of particular interest if you design,\\nbuild, and maintain WebApps over the long term.\\nuote:\\n“If products are\\ndesigned to better\\nfit the natural\\ntendencies of\\nhuman behavior,\\nthen people will\\nbe more satisfied,\\nmore fulfilled, and\\nmore productive.”\\nSusan\\nWeinschenk\\npre75977_ch13.qxd  11/27/08  5:47 PM  Page 374'),\n",

WebApps have become heavily integrated with critical corporate and\\ngovernment databases. E-commerce applications extract and then store sensitive\\ncustomer information. For these and many other reasons, WebApp security is para-\\nmount in many situations. The key measure of security is the ability of the WebApp\\nand its server environment to rebuff unauthorized access and/or thwart an outright\\nmalevolent attack. A detailed discussion of WebApp security is beyond the scope of\\nthis book. If you have further interest, see [Vac06], [Kiz05], or [Kal03].\\nAvailability. Even the best WebApp will not meet users’ needs if it is unavailable.\\nIn a technical sense, availability is the measure of the percentage of time that a\\nWebApp is available for use. The typical end user expects WebApps to be available\\n24/7/365. Anything less is deemed unacceptable.\\n3 But “up-time” is not the only in-\\ndicator of availability. Offutt [Off02] suggests that “using features available on only\\none browser or one platform” makes the WebApp unavailable to those with a differ-\\nent browser/platform configuration. The user will invariably go elsewhere.\\nScalability. Can the WebApp and its server environment be scaled to handle 100,\\n1000, 10,000, or 100,000 users? Will the WebApp and the systems with which it is\\ninterfaced handle significant variation in volume or will responsiveness drop dra-\\nmatically (or cease altogether)? It is not enough to build a WebApp that is successful.\\nIt is equally important to build a WebApp that can accommodate the burden of suc-\\ncess (significantly more end users) and become even more successful.\\nCHAPTER 13 WEBAPP DESIGN 375\\nWeb\\napplication\\nquality\\nUsability\\nGlobal site understandability\\nOnline feedback and help features\\nInterface and aesthetic features\\nSpecial features\\nSearching and retrieving capability\\nNavigation and browsing features\\nApplication domain-related features\\nCorrect link processing\\nError recovery\\nUser input validation and recovery\\nEase of correction\\nAdaptability\\nExtensibility\\nResponse time performance\\nPage generation speed\\nGraphics generation speed\\nFunctionality\\nReliability\\nEfficiency\\nMaintainability\\nFIGURE 13.1\\nQuality\\nrequirements\\ntree.\\nSource: [Ols99].\\nWhat are\\nthe major\\nattributes of\\nquality for\\nWebApps?\\n?\\n3 This expectation is, of course, unrealistic.

Although it may seem old-fashioned, the aphorism “all things in mod-\\neration” applies to WebApps. There is a tendency among some designers to provide\\nthe end user with “too much”—exhaustive content, extreme visuals, intrusive ani-\\nmation, enormous Web pages, the list is long. Better to strive for moderation and\\nsimplicity.\\nContent should be informative but succinct and should use a delivery mode\\n(e.g., text, graphics, video, audio) that is appropriate to the information that is being\\ndelivered. Aesthetics should be pleasing, but not overwhelming (e.g., too many colors\\ntend to distract the user rather than enhancing the interaction). Architecture should\\nachieve WebApp objectives in the simplest possible manner. Navigation should be\\nstraightforward and navigation mechanisms should be intuitively obvious to the end\\nuser. Functions should be easy to use and easier to understand.\\nConsistency. This design goal applies to virtually every element of the design\\nmodel. Content should be constructed consistently (e.g., text formatting and font\\nstyles should be the same across all text documents; graphic art should have a con-\\nsistent look, color scheme, and style). Graphic design (aesthetics) should present a\\nconsistent look across all parts of the WebApp. Architectural design should establish\\ntemplates that lead to a consistent hypermedia structure. Interface design should de-\\nfine consistent modes of interaction, navigation, and content display. Navigation\\nmechanisms should be used consistently across all WebApp elements. As Kaiser\\n[Kai02] notes: “Remember that to a visitor, a Web site is a physical place. It is con-\\nfusing if pages within a site are not consistent in design.“\\nIdentity. The aesthetic, interface, and navigational design of a WebApp must be\\nconsistent with the application domain for which it is to be built. A website for a hip-\\nhop group will undoubtedly have a different look and feel than a WebApp designed\\nfor a financial services company. The WebApp architecture will be entirely different,\\ninterfaces will be constructed to accommodate different categories of users; naviga-\\ntion will be organized to accomplish different objectives. You (and other design con-\\ntributors) should work to establish an identity for the WebApp through the design.\\nRobustness. Based on the identity that has been established, a WebApp often\\nmakes an implicit “promise” to a user. The user expects robust content and functions\\nthat are relevant to the user’s needs. If these elements are missing or insufficient, it\\nis likely that the WebApp will fail.\\nNavigability. I have already noted that navigation should be simple and consis-\\ntent. It should also be designed in a manner that is intuitive and predictable. That is,\\nCHAPTER 13 WEBAPP DESIGN 377\\nuote:\\n“Just because you\\ncan, doesn’t mean\\nyou should.”\\nJean Kaiser\\nuote:\\n“To some, Web\\ndesign focuses on\\nvisual look and\\nfeel . . .

If page scrolling is required (and this is often\\nthe case), links at the top and bottom of the page make the user’s navigation tasks\\neasier.\\nVisual Appeal. Of all software categories, Web applications are unquestionably\\nthe most visual, the most dynamic, and the most unapologetically aesthetic. Beauty\\n(visual appeal) is undoubtedly in the eye of the beholder, but many design charac-\\nteristics (e.g., the look and feel of content; interface layout; color coordination; the\\nbalance of text, graphics, and other media; navigation mechanisms) do contribute to\\nvisual appeal.\\nCompatibility.

This simple question is more difficult to answer than one\\nmight believe. In our book [Pre08] on Web engineering, David Lowe and I discuss this\\nwhen we write:\\nThe creation of an effective design will typically require a diverse set of skills. Sometimes,\\nfor small projects, a single developer may need to be multi-skilled. For larger projects, it\\nmay be advisable and/or feasible to draw on the expertise of specialists: Web engineers,\\ngraphic designers, content developers, programmers, database specialists, information\\narchitects, network engineers, security experts, and testers. Drawing on these diverse\\nskills allows the creation of a model that can be assessed for quality and improved before\\ncontent and code are generated, tests are conducted, and end-users become involved in\\nlarge numbers. If analysis is where WebApp quality is established,then design is where the\\nquality is truly embedded.\\nThe appropriate mix of design skills will vary depending upon the nature of the\\nWebApp. Figure 13.2 depicts a design pyramid for WebApps. Each level of the pyra-\\nmid represents a design action that is described in the sections that follow.\\n13.4 W EB APP INTERFACE DESIGN\\nWhen a user interacts with a computer-based system, a set of fundamental\\nprinciples and overriding design guidelines apply.

That is, the user may enter the WebApp at a “home” loca-\\ntion (e.g., the home page) or may be linked into some lower level of the WebApp\\narchitecture. In some cases, the WebApp can be designed in a way that reroutes the\\nuser to a home location, but if this is undesirable, the WebApp design must provide\\ninterface navigation features that accompany all content objects and are available\\nregardless of how the user enters the system.\\nThe objectives of a WebApp interface are to: (1) establish a consistent window\\ninto the content and functionality provided by the interface, (2) guide the user\\nthrough a series of interactions with the WebApp, and (3) organize the navigation\\noptions and content available to the user. To achieve a consistent interface, you\\nshould first use aesthetic design (Section 13.5) to establish a coherent “look.” This\\nencompasses many characteristics, but must emphasize the layout and form of nav-\\nigation mechanisms. To guide user interaction, you may draw on an appropriate\\nmetaphor\\n5 that enables the user to gain an intuitive understanding of the interface.\\nTo implement navigation options, you can select from one of a number of interac-\\ntion mechanisms:\\n• Navigation menus—keyword menus (organized vertically or horizontally) that\\nlist key content and/or functionality.

Without it, a WebApp may be functional, but\\nunappealing. With it, a WebApp draws its users into a world that embraces them on\\na visceral, as well as an intellectual level.\\nBut what is aesthetic? There is an old saying, “beauty exists in the eye of the be-\\nholder.” This is particularly appropriate when aesthetic design for WebApps is con-\\nsidered. To perform effective aesthetic design, return to the user hierarchy developed\\nas part of the requirements model (Chapter 5) and ask, Who are the WebApp’s users\\nand what “look” do they desire?\\n13.5.1 Layout Issues\\nEvery Web page has a limited amount of “real estate” that can be used to support non-\\nfunctional aesthetics, navigation features, informational content, and user-directed\\nfunctionality. The development of this real estate is planned during aesthetic design.\\nLike all aesthetic issues, there are no absolute rules when screen layout is de-\\nsigned. However, a number of general layout guidelines are worth considering:\\nDon’t be afraid of white space. It is inadvisable to pack every square\\ninch of a Web page with information. The resulting clutter makes it difficult\\nfor the user to identify needed information or features and create visual\\nchaos that is not pleasing to the eye.\\nEmphasize content. After all, that’s the reason the user is there. Nielsen\\n[Nie00] suggests that the typical Web page should be 80 percent content with\\nthe remaining real estate dedicated to navigation and other features.\\nOrganize layout elements from top-left to bottom-right.

First, a design representation for content objects and the mech-\\nanisms required to establish their relationship to one another is developed. In addition,\\nthe information within a specific content object is created. The latter task may be con-\\nducted by copywriters, graphic designers, and others who generate the content to be\\nused within a WebApp.\\n13.6.1 Content Objects\\nThe relationship between content objects defined as part of a requirements model\\nfor the WebApp and design objects representing content is analogous to the rela-\\ntionship between analysis classes and design components described in earlier chap-\\nters. In the context of WebApp design, a content object is more closely aligned with\\na data object for traditional software. A content object has attributes that include\\ncontent-specific information (normally defined during WebApp requirements mod-\\neling) and implementation-specific attributes that are specified as part of design.\\nAs an example, consider an analysis class, ProductComponent, developed for\\nthe SafeHome e-commerce system. The analysis class attribute, description, is repre-\\nsented as a design class namedCompDescription composed of five content objects:\\nMarketingDescription, Photograph, TechDescription, Schematic, and Video\\nshown as shaded objects noted in Figure 13.3. Information contained within the con-\\ntent object is noted as attributes. For example,Photograph (a .jpg image) has the at-\\ntributes horizontal dimension, vertical dimension,and border style.\\nUML association and an aggregation\\n7 may be used to represent relationships\\nbetween content objects. For example, the UML association shown in Figure 13.3\\nindicates that one CompDescription is used for each instance of the\\nProductComponent class. CompDescription is composed on the five content ob-\\njects shown. However, the multiplicity notation shown indicates thatSchematic and\\nVideoare optional (0 occurrences are possible), oneMarketingDescriptionand one\\nTechDescriptionare required, and one or more instances ofPhotograph are used.\\n13.6.2 Content Design Issues\\nOnce all content objects are modeled, the information that each object is to deliver\\nmust be authored and then formatted to best meet the customer’s needs. Content au-\\nthoring is the job of specialists in the relevant area who design the content object by\\nproviding an outline of information to be delivered and an indication of the types of\\ngeneric content objects (e.g., descriptive text, graphic images, photographs) that will\\nbe used to deliver the information. Aesthetic design (Section 13.5) may also be\\napplied to represent the proper look and feel for the content.\\n382 PART TWO MODELING\\nuote:\\n“Good designers\\ncan create\\nnormalcy out\\nof chaos; they\\ncan clearly\\ncommunicate ideas\\nthrough the\\norganizing and\\nmanipulating of\\nwords and\\npictures.”\\nJeffery Veen\\n7 Both of these representations are discussed in Appendix 1.\\npre75977_ch13.qxd  11/27/08  5:47 PM  Page 382'),\n",

The sequence of content presentation is predefined and generally linear.\\nAnother example might be a product order entry sequence in which specific infor-\\nmation must be specified in a specific order. In such cases, the structures shown in\\nFigure 13.4 are appropriate. As content and processing become more complex, the\\npurely linear flow shown on the left of the figure gives way to more sophisticated lin-\\near structures in which alternative content may be invoked or a diversion to acquire\\ncomplementary content (structure shown on the right side of Figure 13.4) occurs.\\nGrid structures (Figure 13.5) are an architectural option that you can apply when\\nWebApp content can be organized categorically in two (or more) dimensions. For\\nexample, consider a situation in which an e-commerce site sells golf clubs. The hori-\\nzontal dimension of the grid represents the type of club to be sold (e.g., woods, irons,\\nwedges, putters). The vertical dimension represents the offerings provided by vari-\\nous golf club manufacturers. Hence, a user might navigate the grid horizontally to\\nfind the putters column and then vertically to examine the offerings provided by\\n384 PART TWO MODELING\\nWhat types\\nof content\\narchitectures are\\ncommonly\\nencountered?\\n?\\nLinear Linear\\nwith\\noptional flow\\nLinear\\nwith\\ndiversions\\nFIGURE 13.4\\nLinear \\nstructures\\npre75977_ch13.qxd  11/27/08  5:47 PM  Page 384'),\n",

Jacyntho and his colleagues [Jac02b]\\ndescribe the basic characteristics of this infrastructure in the following manner:\\nApplications should be built using layers in which different concerns are taken into\\naccount; in particular, application data should be separated from the page’s contents\\n(navigation nodes) and these contents, in turn, should be clearly separated from the\\ninterface look-and-feel (pages).\\nThe authors suggest a three-layer design architecture that decouples interface from\\nnavigation and from application behavior.

To accomplish this, you should (1) identify the semantics of\\nnavigation for different users of the site, and (2) define the mechanics (syntax) of\\nachieving the navigation.\\n13.8.1 Navigation Semantics\\nLike many WebApp design actions, navigation design begins with a consideration of\\nthe user hierarchy and related use cases (Chapter 5) developed for each category\\nof user (actor). Each actor may use the WebApp somewhat differently and therefore\\nhave different navigation requirements. In addition, the use cases developed for\\neach actor will define a set of classes that encompass one or more content objects\\nor WebApp functions. As each user interacts with the WebApp, she encounters a\\nseries of navigation semantic units (NSUs)—“a set of information and related naviga-\\ntion structures that collaborate in the fulfillment of a subset of related user\\nrequirements” [Cac02].\\nAn NSU is composed of a set of navigation elements called ways of navigating\\n(WoN) [Gna99]. A WoN represents the best navigation pathway to achieve a naviga-\\ntional goal for a specific type of user. Each WoN is organized as a set of navigational\\nnodes (NN) that are connected by navigational links. In some cases, a navigational\\nlink may be another NSU. Therefore, the overall navigation structure for a WebApp\\nmay be organized as a hierarchy of NSUs.\\nTo illustrate the development of an NSU, consider the use case Select SafeHome\\nComponents:\\nUse Case: Select SafeHome Components\\nThe WebApp will recommend product components (e.g., control panels, sensors, cam-\\neras) and other features (e.g., PC-based functionality implemented in software) for each\\nroom and exterior entrance . If I request alternatives, the WebApp will provide them, if\\nthey exist. I will be able to get descriptive and pricing information for each product\\ncomponent. The WebApp will create and display a bill-of-materials as I select various\\ncomponents. I’ll be able to give the bill-of-materials a name and save it for future\\nreference (see use case Save Configuration).\\nThe underlined items in the use-case description represent classes and content objects\\nthat will be incorporated into one or more NSUs that will enable a new customer to\\nperform the scenario described in theSelect SafeHome Componentsuse case.\\nFigure 13.9 depicts a partial semantic analysis of the navigation implied by\\nthe Select SafeHome Components use case. Using the terminology intro-\\nduced earlier, the figure also represents a way of navigating (WoN) for the\\n388 PART TWO MODELING\\nuote:\\n“Just wait, Gretel,\\nuntil the moon\\nrises, and then we\\nshall see the\\ncrumbs of bread\\nwhich I have\\nstrewn about, they\\nwill show us our\\nway home again.”\\nHansel and\\nGretel\\nAn NSU describes\\nthe navigation\\nrequirements for each\\nuse case.

OOHDM uses a predefined\\nset of navigation classes—nodes, links, anchors, and access structures [Sch98b].\\nAccess structures are more elaborate and include mechanisms such as a WebApp\\nindex, a site map, or a guided tour.\\nOnce navigation classes are defined, OOHDM “structures the navigation space by\\ngrouping navigation objects into sets called contexts” [Sch98b].

A context template (analogous to CRC cards discussed in Chapter 6) is de-\\nveloped and may be used to track the navigation requirements of each category of\\nuser through the various contexts defined in OOHDM.

Content design begins with the representation of content objects, their as-\\nsociations, and relationships. A set of browsing primitives establishes the basis for\\nnavigation design.\\nArchitecture design identifies the overall hypermedia structure for the WebApp\\nand encompasses both content architecture and WebApp architecture.

Developers\\nblame customers (and other stakeholders), arguing that irrational delivery dates and\\na continuing stream of changes force them to deliver software before it has been fully\\nvalidated. Who’s right? Both—and that’s the problem. In this chapter, I consider soft-\\nware quality as a concept and examine why it’s worthy of serious consideration\\nwhenever software engineering practices are applied.\\n14.1 W HAT IS QUALITY ?\\nIn his mystical book, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,Robert Persig [Per74]\\ncommented on the thing we call quality:\\nQuality . . . you know what it is, yet you don’t know what it is. But that’s self-contradictory.\\nBut some things are better than others; that is, they have more quality. But when you try\\nto say what the quality is, apart from the things that have it, it all goes poof! There’s noth-\\ning to talk about. But if you can’t say what Quality is, how do you know what it is, or how\\ndo you know that it even exists? If no one knows what it is, then for all practical purposes\\nit doesn’t exist at all. But for all practical purposes it really does exist. What else are the\\ngrades based on? Why else would people pay fortunes for some things and throw others\\nin the trash pile? Obviously some things are better than others . . . but what’s the better-\\nness? . . . So round and round you go, spinning mental wheels and nowhere finding any-\\nplace to get traction. What the hell is Quality? What is it?\\nIndeed—what is it?\\nAt a somewhat more pragmatic level, David Garvin [Gar84] of the Harvard Busi-\\nness School suggests that “quality is a complex and multifaceted concept” that can\\nbe described from five different points of view. The transcendental view argues (like\\nPersig) that quality is something that you immediately recognize, but cannot explic-\\nitly define. The user view sees quality in terms of an end user’s specific goals. If a\\nproduct meets those goals, it exhibits quality. The manufacturer’s viewdefines qual-\\nity in terms of the original specification of the product. If the product conforms to the\\nspec, it exhibits quality. The product view suggests that quality can be tied to inher-\\nent characteristics (e.g., functions and features) of a product. Finally, the value-based\\nview measures quality based on how much a customer is willing to pay for a prod-\\nuct. In reality, quality encompasses all of these views and more.\\nQuality of design refers to the characteristics that designers specify for a product.\\nThe grade of materials, tolerances, and performance specifications all contribute to\\nthe quality of design. As higher-grade materials are used, tighter tolerances and\\nWhat are the different\\nways in which quality\\ncan be viewed?\\npre75977_ch14.qxd  11/27/08  5:51 PM  Page 399'),\n",

Quality\\nof conformance focuses on the degree to which the implementation follows the\\ndesign and the resulting system meets its requirements and performance goals.\\nBut are quality of design and quality of conformance the only issues that software\\nengineers must consider? Robert Glass [Gla98] argues that a more “intuitive” rela-\\ntionship is in order:\\nuser satisfaction /H11549compliant product /H11545good quality /H11545delivery within budget and schedule\\nAt the bottom line, Glass contends that quality is important, but if the user isn’t\\nsatisfied, nothing else really matters. DeMarco [DeM98] reinforces this view when he\\nstates: “A product’s quality is a function of how much it changes the world for the\\nbetter.” This view of quality contends that if a software product provides substantial\\nbenefit to its end users, they may be willing to tolerate occasional reliability or per-\\nformance problems.\\n14.2 S OFTWARE QUALITY\\nEven the most jaded software developers will agree that high-quality software is an\\nimportant goal. But how do we define software quality? In the most general sense,\\nsoftware quality can be defined\\n1 as: An effective software process applied in a manner\\nthat creates a useful product that provides measurable value for those who produce it\\nand those who use it.\\nThere is little question that the preceding definition could be modified or extended\\nand debated endlessly. For the purposes of this book, the definition serves to\\nemphasize three important points:\\n1. An effective software process establishes the infrastructure that supports any\\neffort at building a high-quality software product. The management aspects\\nof process create the checks and balances that help avoid project chaos—a\\nkey contributor to poor quality.

A useful product always satisfies those requirements that have been\\nexplicitly stated by stakeholders.

By adding value for both the producer and user of a software product, high-\\nquality software provides benefits for the software organization and the end-\\nuser community. The software organization gains added value because\\nhigh-quality software requires less maintenance effort, fewer bug fixes, and\\nreduced customer support. This enables software engineers to spend more\\ntime creating new applications and less on rework. The user community\\ngains added value because the application provides a useful capability in\\na way that expedites some business process.

Although Garvin’s eight dimensions of\\nquality were not developed specifically for software, they can be applied when soft-\\nware quality is considered:\\nPerformance quality. Does the software deliver all content, functions, and\\nfeatures that are specified as part of the requirements model in a way that\\nprovides value to the end user?\\nFeature quality. Does the software provide features that surprise and\\ndelight first-time end users?\\nReliability. Does the software deliver all features and capability without\\nfailure? Is it available when it is needed? Does it deliver functionality that is\\nerror-free?\\nConformance. Does the software conform to local and external software\\nstandards that are relevant to the application? Does it conform to de facto\\ndesign and coding conventions? For example, does the user interface con-\\nform to accepted design rules for menu selection or data input?\\nDurability. Can the software be maintained (changed) or corrected\\n(debugged) without the inadvertent generation of unintended side effects?\\nWill changes cause the error rate or reliability to degrade with time?\\nServiceability. Can the software be maintained (changed) or corrected\\n(debugged) in an acceptably short time period? Can support staff acquire all\\ninformation they need to make changes or correct defects?

There’s no question that each of us has a different and very\\nsubjective vision of what is aesthetic. And yet, most of us would agree that\\nan aesthetic entity has a certain elegance, a unique flow, and an obvious\\n“presence” that are hard to quantify but are evident nonetheless. Aesthetic\\nsoftware has these characteristics.\\nPerception. In some situations, you have a set of prejudices that will influ-\\nence your perception of quality. For example, if you are introduced to a soft-\\nware product that was built by a vendor who has produced poor quality in\\nthe past, your guard will be raised and your perception of the current soft-\\nware product quality might be influenced negatively. Similarly, if a vendor\\nhas an excellent reputation, you may perceive quality, even when it does not\\nreally exist.\\nGarvin’s quality dimensions provide you with a “soft” look at software quality.\\nMany (but not all) of these dimensions can only be considered subjectively. For this\\nreason, you also need a set of “hard” quality factors that can be categorized in two\\nbroad groups: (1) factors that can be directly measured (e.g., defects uncovered dur-\\ning testing) and (2) factors that can be measured only indirectly (e.g., usability or\\nmaintainability). In each case measurement must occur. You should compare the\\nsoftware to some datum and arrive at an indication of quality.\\n14.2.2 McCall’s Quality Factors\\nMcCall, Richards, and Walters [McC77] propose a useful categorization of factors\\nthat affect software quality. These software quality factors, shown in Figure 14.1,\\nfocus on three important aspects of a software product: its operational characteris-\\ntics, its ability to undergo change, and its adaptability to new environments.\\nReferring to the factors noted in Figure 14.1, McCall and his colleagues provide\\nthe following descriptions:\\nCorrectness. The extent to which a program satisfies its specification and fulfills the\\ncustomer’s mission objectives.\\nReliability. The extent to which a program can be expected to perform its intended func-\\ntion with required precision. [It should be noted that other, more complete definitions of\\nreliability have been proposed (see Chapter 25).]\\nEfficiency. The amount of computing resources and code required by a program to\\nperform its function.\\nIntegrity. Extent to which access to software or data by unauthorized persons can be\\ncontrolled.\\nUsability. Effort required to learn, operate, prepare input for, and interpret output of a\\nprogram.\\n402 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\npre75977_ch14.qxd  11/27/08  5:51 PM  Page 402'),\n",

The standard identifies six key quality attributes:\\nFunctionality. The degree to which the software satisfies stated needs as\\nindicated by the following subattributes: suitability, accuracy, interoperability,\\ncompliance, and security.\\nReliability.

A software team can develop a set of quality characteristics and associ-\\nated questions that would probe\\n3 the degree to which each factor has been satisfied.\\nFor example, McCall identifies usability as an important quality factor. If you were\\nasked to review a user interface and assess its usability, how would you proceed?\\nYou might start with the subattributes suggested by McCall—understandability,\\nlearnability, and operability—but what do these mean in a pragmatic sense?\\nTo conduct your assessment, you’ll need to address specific, measurable (or at\\nleast, recognizable) attributes of the interface. For example [Bro03]:\\nIntuitiveness. The degree to which the interface follows expected usage patterns\\nso that even a novice can use it without significant training.\\n• Is the interface layout conducive to easy understanding?\\n• Are interface operations easy to locate and initiate?\\n• Does the interface use a recognizable metaphor?\\n• Is input specified to economize key strokes or mouse clicks?\\n• Does the interface follow the three golden rules?

A collection of questions\\nsimilar to these would be developed for each quality factor to be assessed.\\n14.2.5 The Transition to a Quantitative View\\nIn the preceding subsections, I have presented a variety of qualitative factors for the\\n“measurement” of software quality. The software engineering community strives to\\ndevelop precise measures for software quality and is sometimes frustrated by the\\nsubjective nature of the activity. Cavano and McCall [Cav78] discuss this situation:\\nThe determination of quality is a key factor in every day events—wine tasting contests,\\nsporting events [e.g., gymnastics], talent contests, etc. In these situations, quality is\\njudged in the most fundamental and direct manner: side by side comparison of objects\\nunder identical conditions and with predetermined concepts. The wine may be judged\\naccording to clarity, color, bouquet, taste, etc. However, this type of judgment is very sub-\\njective; to have any value at all, it must be made by an expert.\\nCHAPTER 14 QUALITY CONCEPTS 405\\npre75977_ch14.qxd  11/27/08  5:51 PM  Page 405'),\n",

To help\\nsolve this problem, a more precise definition of software quality is needed as well as a\\nway to derive quantitative measurements of software quality for objective analysis. . . .\\nSince there is no such thing as absolute knowledge, one should not expect to measure\\nsoftware quality exactly, for every measurement is partially imperfect. Jacob Bronkowski\\ndescribed this paradox of knowledge in this way: “Year by year we devise more precise\\ninstruments with which to observe nature with more fineness. And when we look at the\\nobservations we are discomfited to see that they are still fuzzy, and we feel that they are\\nas uncertain as ever.”\\nIn Chapter 23, I’ll present a set of software metrics that can be applied to the quan-\\ntitative assessment of software quality. In all cases, the metrics represent indirect\\nmeasures; that is, we never really measure quality but rather some manifestation of\\nquality. The complicating factor is the precise relationship between the variable that\\nis measured and the quality of software.\\n14.3 T HE SOFTWARE QUALITY DILEMMA\\nIn an interview [Ven03] published on the Web, Bertrand Meyer discusses what I call\\nthe quality dilemma:\\nIf you produce a software system that has terrible quality, you lose because no one will\\nwant to buy it. If on the other hand you spend infinite time, extremely large effort, and\\nhuge sums of money to build the absolutely perfect piece of software, then it’s going to\\ntake so long to complete and it will be so expensive to produce that you’ll be out of busi-\\nness anyway. Either you missed the market window, or you simply exhausted all your\\nresources. So people in industry try to get to that magical middle ground where the prod-\\nuct is good enough not to be rejected right away, such as during evaluation, but also not\\nthe object of so much perfectionism and so much work that it would take too long or cost\\ntoo much to complete.\\nIt’s fine to state that software engineers should strive to produce high-quality\\nsystems. It’s even better to apply good practices in your attempt to do so. But the\\nsituation discussed by Meyer is real life and represents a dilemma for even the best\\nsoftware engineering organizations.\\n14.3.1 “Good Enough” Software\\nStated bluntly, if we are to accept the argument made by Meyer, is it acceptable\\nto produce “good enough” software? The answer to this question must be “yes,”\\nbecause major software companies do it every day. They create software with known\\nbugs and deliver it to a broad population of end users. They recognize that some of\\nthe functions and features delivered in Version 1.0 may not be of the highest quality\\nand plan for improvements in Version 2.0. They do this knowing that some cus-\\ntomers will complain, but they recognize that time-to-market may trump better qual-\\nity as long as the delivered product is “good enough.”\\n406 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nWhen you’re faced\\nwith the quality\\ndilemma (and\\neveryone is faced\\nwith it at one time\\nor another), try to\\nachieve balance—\\nenough effort to\\nproduce acceptable\\nquality without burying\\nthe project.\\npre75977_ch14.qxd  11/27/08  5:51 PM  Page 406'),\n",

Good enough software delivers high-quality func-\\ntions and features that users desire, but at the same time it delivers other more\\nobscure or specialized functions and features that contain known bugs. The soft-\\nware vendor hopes that the vast majority of end users will overlook the bugs because\\nthey are so happy with other application functionality.\\nThis idea may resonate with many readers. If you’re one of them, I can only ask\\nyou to consider some of the arguments against “good enough.”\\nIt is true that “good enough” may work in some application domains and for a few\\nmajor software companies. After all, if a company has a large marketing budget and\\ncan convince enough people to buy version 1.0, it has succeeded in locking them in.\\nAs I noted earlier, it can argue that it will improve quality in subsequent versions. By\\ndelivering a good enough version 1.0, it has cornered the market.\\nIf you work for a small company be wary of this philosophy. When you deliver a\\ngood enough (buggy) product, you risk permanent damage to your company’s repu-\\ntation. You may never get a chance to deliver version 2.0 because bad buzz may\\ncause your sales to plummet and your company to fold.\\nIf you work in certain application domains (e.g., real-time embedded software) or\\nbuild application software that is integrated with hardware (e.g., automotive soft-\\nware, telecommunications software), delivering software with known bugs can be\\nnegligent and open your company to expensive litigation. In some cases, it can even\\nbe criminal. No one wants good enough aircraft avionics software!\\nSo, proceed with caution if you believe that “good enough” is a short cut that can\\nsolve your software quality problems. It can work, but only for a few and only in a\\nlimited set of application domains.\\n4\\n14.3.2 The Cost of Quality\\nThe argument goes something like this—we know that quality is important, but it costs\\nus time and money—too much time and money to get the level of software quality we\\nreally want. On its face, this argument seems reasonable (see Meyer’s comments ear-\\nlier in this section). There is no question that quality has a cost, but lack of quality also\\nhas a cost—not only to end users who must live with buggy software, but also to the\\nsoftware organization that has built and must maintain it. The real question is this:\\nwhich cost should we be worried about?To answer this question, you must understand\\nboth the cost of achieving quality and the cost of low-quality software.\\nThe cost of quality includes all costs incurred in the pursuit of quality or in per-\\nforming quality-related activities and the downstream costs of lack of quality. To\\nunderstand these costs, an organization must collect metrics to provide a baseline\\nfor the current cost of quality, identify opportunities for reducing these costs, and\\nprovide a normalized basis of comparison. The cost of quality can be divided into\\ncosts associated with prevention, appraisal, and failure.\\nCHAPTER 14 QUALITY CONCEPTS 407\\n4 A worthwhile discussion of the pros and cons of “good enough” software can be found in [Bre02].\\npre75977_ch14.qxd  11/27/08  5:52 PM  Page 407'),\n",

Examples of appraisal costs include:\\n• Cost of conducting technical reviews (Chapter 15) for software engineering\\nwork products\\n• Cost of data collection and metrics evaluation (Chapter 23)\\n• Cost of testing and debugging (Chapters 18 through 21)\\nFailure costs are those that would disappear if no errors appeared before or after\\nshipping a product to customers. Failure costs may be subdivided into internal failure\\ncosts and external failure costs. Internal failure costsare incurred when you detect an\\nerror in a product prior to shipment. Internal failure costs include\\n• Cost required to perform rework (repair) to correct an error\\n• Cost that occurs when rework inadvertently generates side effects that must\\nbe mitigated\\n• Costs associated with the collection of quality metrics that allow an organi-\\nzation to assess the modes of failure\\nExternal failure costs are associated with defects found after the product has been\\nshipped to the customer.

Bad things\\nhappen when low-quality software is produced.\\nIn an indictment of software developers who refuse to consider external failure\\ncosts, Cem Kaner [Kan95] states:\\nMany of the external failure costs, such as goodwill, are difficult to quantify, and many com-\\npanies therefore ignore them when calculating their cost-benefit tradeoffs. Other external\\nfailure costs can be reduced (e.g. by providing cheaper, lower-quality, post-sale support, or\\nby charging customers for support) without increasing customer satisfaction. By ignoring\\nthe costs to our customers of bad products, quality engineers encourage quality -related\\ndecision-making that victimizes our customers, rather than delighting them.\\nAs expected, the relative costs to find and repair an error or defect increase dra-\\nmatically as we go from prevention to detection to internal failure to external failure\\ncosts.

What caused this tragedy? A software\\npackage, developed by a U.S. company, was modified by hospital technicians to\\ncompute doses of radiation for each patient.\\nThe three Panamanian medical physicists, who “tweeked” the software to provide\\nadditional capability, were charged with second-degree murder.

This also\\nis not a tale of how human beings can be injured or worse by poorly designed or poorly\\nexplained software, although there are plenty of examples to make the point. This is a\\nwarning for any creator of computer programs: that software quality matters, that appli-\\ncations must be foolproof, and that—whether embedded in the engine of a car, a robotic\\narm in a factory or a healing device in a hospital—poorly deployed code can kill.\\nPoor quality leads to risks, some of them very serious.\\n14.3.4 Negligence and Liability\\nThe story is all too common. A governmental or corporate entity hires a major soft-\\nware developer or consulting company to analyze requirements and then design and\\nconstruct a software-based “system” to support some major activity. The system\\nmight support a major corporate function (e.g., pension management) or some gov-\\nernmental function (e.g., health care administration or homeland security).\\nWork begins with the best of intentions on both sides, but by the time the system is\\ndelivered, things have gone bad. The system is late, fails to deliver desired features and\\nfunctions, is error-prone, and does not meet with customer approval. Litigation ensues.\\nIn most cases, the customer claims that the developer has been negligent (in the\\nmanner in which it has applied software practices) and is therefore not entitled to\\npayment. The developer often claims that the customer has repeatedly changed its\\nrequirements and has subverted the development partnership in other ways. In every\\ncase, the quality of the delivered system comes into question.\\n14.3.5 Quality and Security\\nAs the criticality of Web-based systems and applications grows, application security\\nhas become increasingly important. Stated simply, software that does not exhibit\\nhigh quality is easier to hack, and as a consequence, low-quality software can indi-\\nrectly increase the security risk with all of its attendant costs and problems.\\nIn an interview in ComputerWorld,author and security expert Gary McGraw com-\\nments [Wil05]:\\nSoftware security relates entirely and completely to quality.

The earlier you find\\nthe software problem, the better. And there are two kinds of software problems. One is\\nbugs, which are implementation problems. The other is software flaws—architectural\\nproblems in the design. People pay too much attention to bugs and not enough on flaws.\\nTo build a secure system, you must focus on quality, and that focus must begin dur-\\ning design. The concepts and methods discussed in Part 2 of this book lead to a soft-\\nware architecture that reduces “flaws.” By eliminating architectural flaws (thereby\\nimproving software quality), you will make it far more difficult to hack the software.\\n14.3.6 The Impact of Management Actions\\nSoftware quality is often influenced as much by management decisions as it is by\\ntechnology decisions. Even the best software engineering practices can be subverted\\nby poor business decisions and questionable project management actions.\\nIn Part 4 of this book I discuss project management within the context of the soft-\\nware process. As each project task is initiated, a project leader will make decisions\\nthat can have a significant impact on product quality.\\nEstimation decisions. As I note in Chapter 26, a software team is rarely given the\\nluxury of providing an estimate for a project beforedelivery dates are established and\\nan overall budget is specified. Instead, the team conducts a “sanity check” to ensure\\nthat delivery dates and milestones are rational. In many cases there is enormous\\ntime-to-market pressure that forces a team to accept unrealistic delivery dates. As a\\nconsequence, shortcuts are taken, activities that lead to higher-quality software may\\nbe skipped, and product quality suffers. If a delivery date is irrational, it is important\\nto hold your ground. Explain why you need more time, or alternatively, suggest a\\nsubset of functionality that can be delivered (with high quality) in the time allotted.\\nScheduling decisions. When a software project schedule is established\\n(Chapter 27), tasks are sequenced based on dependencies. For example, because\\ncomponent A depends on processing that occurs within components B, C, and D,\\ncomponent A cannot be scheduled for testing until components B, C,and D are fully\\ntested. A project schedule would reflect this. But if time is very short, and Amust be\\navailable for further critical testing, you might decide to test A without its subordi-\\nnate components (which are running slightly behind schedule), so that you can make\\nit available for other testing that must be done before delivery. After all, the deadline\\nlooms. As a consequence, Amay have defects that are hidden, only to be discovered\\nmuch later. Quality suffers.\\nRisk-oriented decisions. Risk management (Chapter 28) is one of the key attrib-\\nutes of a successful software project. You really do need to know what might go\\nwrong and establish a contingency plan if it does. Too many software teams prefer\\nblind optimism, establishing a development schedule under the assumption that\\nnothing will go wrong. Worse, they don’t have a way of handling things that do go\\nwrong. As a consequence, when a risk becomes a reality, chaos reigns, and as the\\ndegree of craziness rises, the level of quality invariably falls.\\nCHAPTER 14 QUALITY CONCEPTS 411\\npre75977_ch14.qxd  11/27/08  5:52 PM  Page 411'),\n",

It is the result of good project management and\\nsolid software engineering practice. Management and practice are applied within\\nthe context of four broad activities that help a software team achieve high software\\nquality: software engineering methods, project management techniques, quality\\ncontrol actions, and software quality assurance.\\n14.4.1 Software Engineering Methods\\nIf you expect to build high-quality software, you must understand the problem to be\\nsolved. You must also be capable of creating a design that conforms to the problem\\nwhile at the same time exhibiting characteristics that lead to software that exhibits\\nthe quality dimensions and factors discussed in Section 14.2.\\nIn Part 2 of this book, I presented a wide array of concepts and methods that can\\nlead to a reasonably complete understanding of the problem and a comprehensive\\ndesign that establishes a solid foundation for the construction activity. If you apply\\nthose concepts and adopt appropriate analysis and design methods, the likelihood\\nof creating high-quality software will increase substantially.\\n14.4.2 Project Management Techniques\\nThe impact of poor management decisions on software quality has been discussed in\\nSection 14.3.6. The implications are clear: if (1) a project manager uses estimation to\\nverify that delivery dates are achievable, (2) schedule dependencies are understood\\nand the team resists the temptation to use short cuts, (3) risk planning is conducted so\\nproblems do not breed chaos, software quality will be affected in a positive way.\\nIn addition, the project plan should include explicit techniques for quality and\\nchange management. Techniques that lead to good project management practices\\nare discussed in Part 4 of this book.\\n14.4.3 Quality Control\\nQuality control encompasses a set of software engineering actions that help to\\nensure that each work product meets its quality goals. Models are reviewed to ensure\\nthat they are complete and consistent. Code may be inspected in order to uncover\\nand correct errors before testing commences. A series of testing steps is applied to\\nuncover errors in processing logic, data manipulation, and interface communication.\\nA combination of measurement and feedback allows a software team to tune the\\nprocess when any of these work products fail to meet quality goals. Quality control\\nactivities are discussed in detail throughout the remainder of Part 3 of this book.\\n412 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nWhat do I\\nneed to do to\\naffect quality in a\\npositive way?\\n?\\nWhat is\\nsoftware\\nquality control?\\n?\\npre75977_ch14.qxd  11/27/08  5:52 PM  Page 412'),\n",

In addition, quality assurance\\nconsists of a set of auditing and reporting functions that assess the effectiveness and\\ncompleteness of quality control actions. The goal of quality assurance is to provide\\nmanagement and technical staff with the data necessary to be informed about prod-\\nuct quality, thereby gaining insight and confidence that actions to achieve product\\nquality are working. Of course, if the data provided through quality assurance iden-\\ntifies problems, it is management’s responsibility to address the problems and apply\\nthe necessary resources to resolve quality issues. Software quality assurance is dis-\\ncussed in detail in Chapter 16.\\n14.5 S UMMARY\\nConcern for the quality of the software-based systems has grown as software\\nbecomes integrated into every aspect of our daily lives. But it is difficult to develop\\na comprehensive description of software quality. In this chapter quality has been\\ndefined as an effective software process applied in a manner that creates a useful\\nproduct that provides measurable value for those who produce it and those who\\nuse it.\\nA wide variety of software quality dimensions and factors have been proposed\\nover the years. All try to define a set of characteristics that, if achieved, will lead to\\nhigh software quality. McCall’s and the ISO 9126 quality factors establish character-\\nistics such as reliability, usability, maintainability, functionality, and portability as\\nindicators that quality exists.\\nEvery software organization is faced with the software quality dilemma. In\\nessence, everyone wants to build high-quality systems, but the time and effort\\nrequired to produce “perfect” software are simply unavailable in a market-driven\\nworld. The question becomes, should we build software that is “good enough”?\\nAlthough many companies do just that, there is a significant downside that must be\\nconsidered.\\nRegardless of the approach that is chosen, quality does have a cost that can be\\ndiscussed in terms of prevention, appraisal, and failure. Prevention costs include all\\nsoftware engineering actions that are designed to prevent defects in the first place.\\nAppraisal costs are associated with those actions that assess software work prod-\\nucts to determine their quality. Failure costs encompass the internal price of failure\\nand the external effects that poor quality precipitates.\\nSoftware quality is achieved through the application of software engineering\\nmethods, solid management practices, and comprehensive quality control—all sup-\\nported by a software quality assurance infrastructure.

Both imply a quality problem that is discovered after the software has been\\nreleased to end users (or to another framework activity in the software process). In\\nearlier chapters, we used the term error to depict a quality problem that is discovered\\nby software engineers (or others) before the software is released to the end user (or\\nto another framework activity in the software process).\\nCHAPTER 15 REVIEW TECHNIQUES 417\\nReviews are like a\\nfilter in the software\\nprocess workflow.

These\\nproblems are referred to by various names— bugs, faults,\\nerrors, or defects to name a few. Are each of these terms\\nsynonymous, or are there subtle differences between them?\\nIn this book I make a clear distinction between an error\\n(a quality problem found beforethe software is released to\\nend users) and a defect (a quality problem found only after\\nthe software has been released to end users1). I make this\\ndistinction because errors and defects have very different\\neconomic, business, psychological, and human impact. As\\nsoftware engineers, we want to find and correct as many\\nerrors as possible before the customer and/or end user\\nencounter them. We want to avoid defects—because\\ndefects (justifiably) make software people look bad.\\nIt is important to note, however, that the temporal\\ndistinction made between errors and defects in this book is\\nnot mainstream thinking. The general consensus within the\\nsoftware engineering community is that defects and errors,\\nfaults, and bugs are synonymous.

The obvious benefit of\\ntechnical reviews is the early discovery of errors so that they do not propagate to the\\nnext step in the software process.\\nA number of industry studies indicate that design activities introduce between 50\\nand 65 percent of all errors (and ultimately, all defects) during the software process.\\nHowever, review techniques have been shown to be up to 75 percent effective\\n[Jon86] in uncovering design flaws.

During the action, errors may be inadvertently generated.\\nReview may fail to uncover newly generated errors and errors from previous steps,\\nresulting in some number of errors that are passed through. In some cases, errors\\npassed through from previous steps are amplified (amplification factor, x) by current\\nwork. The box subdivisions represent each of these characteristics and the percent of\\nefficiency for detecting errors, a function of the thoroughness of the review.\\nFigure 15.2 illustrates a hypothetical example of defect amplification for a software\\nprocess in which no reviews are conducted. Referring to the figure, each test step is\\nassumed to uncover and correct 50 percent of all incoming errors without intro-\\nducing any new errors (an optimistic assumption). Ten preliminary design defects are\\namplified to 94 errors before testing commences. Twelve latent errors (defects) are\\nreleased to the field. Figure 15.3 considers the same conditions except that design and\\ncode reviews are conducted as part of each software engineering action. In this case,\\n10 initial preliminary (architectural) design errors are amplified to 24 errors before\\ntesting commences. Only three latent errors exist. The relative costs associated with\\nthe discovery and correction of errors, overall cost (with and without review for our\\nhypothetical example) can be established. The number of errors uncovered during\\neach of the steps noted in Figures 15.2 and 15.3 is multiplied by the cost to remove an\\nclear distinction between pre- and post-release (e.g.,\\nconsider an incremental process used in agile\\ndevelopment).\\nRegardless of how you choose to interpret these\\nterms, recognize that the point in time at which a\\nproblem is discovered does matter and that software\\nengineers should try hard— very hard—to find problems\\nbefore their customers and end users encounter them. If\\nyou have further interest in this issue, a reasonably\\nthorough discussion of the terminology surrounding\\n“bugs” can be found at\\nwww.softwaredevelopment.ca/bugs.shtml .\\nThe primary objective\\nof an FTR is to find\\nerrors before they are\\npassed on to another\\nsoftware engineering\\nactivity or released to\\nthe end user.\\nuote:\\n“Some maladies, as\\ndoctors say, at their\\nbeginning are easy\\nto cure but difficult\\nto recognize … but\\nin the course of time\\nwhen they have not\\nat first been\\nrecognized and\\ntreated, become\\neasy to recognize\\nbut difficult to\\ncure.”\\nNiccolo\\nMachiavelli\\npre75977_ch15.qxd  11/27/08  5:54 PM  Page 418'),\n",

Each action requires dedicated human effort, Since available\\nproject effort is finite, it is important for a software engineering organization to\\nunderstand the effectiveness of each action by defining a set of metrics (Chapter 23)\\nthat can be used to assess their efficacy.\\nAlthough many metrics can be defined for technical reviews, a relatively small\\nsubset can provide useful insight. The following review metrics can be collected for\\neach review that is conducted:\\n• Preparation effort, Ep—the effort (in person-hours) required to review a work\\nproduct prior to the actual review meeting\\n• Assessment effort, Ea—the effort (in person-hours) that is expended during the\\nactual review\\n• Rework effort, Er—the effort (in person-hours) that is dedicated to the correc-\\ntion of those errors uncovered during the review\\n• Work product size, WPS—a measure of the size of the work product that has\\nbeen reviewed (e.g., the number of UML models, or the number of document\\npages, or the number of lines of code)\\n• Minor errors found, Errminor—the number of errors found that can be catego-\\nrized as minor (requiring less than some prespecified effort to correct)\\n• Major errors found, Errmajor—the number of errors found that can be catego-\\nrized as major (requiring more than some prespecified effort to correct)\\nThese metrics can be further refined by associating the type of work product that was\\nreviewed for the metrics collected.\\n15.3.1 Analyzing Metrics\\nBefore analysis can begin, a few simple computations must occur. The total review\\neffort and the total number of errors discovered are defined as:\\nE\\nreview /H11005Ep /H11001Ea /H11001Er\\nErrtot /H11005Errminor /H11001Errmajor\\n420 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\n2 These multipliers are somewhat different than the data presented in Figure 14.2, which is more\\ncurrent.

Error density is 1.2 errors per UML diagram or 0.68\\nerrors per requirements model page.\\nIf reviews are conducted for a number of different types of work products (e.g.,\\nrequirements model, design model, code, test cases), the percentage of errors\\nuncovered for each review can be computed against the total number of errors\\nfound for all reviews. In addition, the error density for each work product can be\\ncomputed.\\nOnce data are collected for many reviews conducted across many projects, aver-\\nage values for error density enable you to estimate the number of errors to be found\\nin a new (as yet unreviewed document). For example, if the average error density for\\na requirements model is 0.6 errors per page, and a new requirement model is 32\\npages long, a rough estimate suggests that your software team will find about 19 or\\n20 errors during the review of the document. If you find only 6 errors, you’ve done\\nan extremely good job in developing the requirements model or your review\\napproach was not thorough enough.\\nOnce testing has been conducted (Chapters 17 through 20), it is possible to collect\\nadditional error data, including the effort required to find and correct errors uncov-\\nered during testing and the error density of the software. The costs associated with\\nfinding and correcting an error during testing can be compared to those for reviews.\\nThis is discussed in Section 15.3.2.\\n15.3.2 Cost Effectiveness of Reviews\\nIt is difficult to measure the cost effectiveness of any technical review in real time. A\\nsoftware engineering organization can assess the effectiveness of reviews and their\\ncost benefit only after reviews have been completed, review metrics have been col-\\nlected, average data have been computed, and then the downstream quality of the\\nsoftware is measured (via testing).\\nReturning to the example presented in Section 15.3.1, the average error density\\nfor requirements models was determined to be 0.6 errors per page. The effort\\nrequired to correct a minor model error (immediately after the review) was found to\\nrequire 4 person-hours. The effort required for a major requirement error was found\\nto be 18 person-hours. Examining the review data collected, you find that minor\\nerrors occur about 6 times more frequently than major errors. Therefore, you can\\nestimate that the average effort to find and correct a requirements error during\\nreview is about 6 person-hours.\\nErr\\ntot\\nWPS\\nCHAPTER 15 REVIEW TECHNIQUES 421\\npre75977_ch15.qxd  11/27/08  5:54 PM  Page 421'),\n",

Hewlett Packard reported\\na 10 to 1 return on investment for inspections and noted that actual product delivery\\naccelerated by an average of 1.8 calendar months.

The formality of a review increases when (1) distinct roles are explicitly\\ndefined for the reviewers, (2) there is a sufficient amount of planning and prepara-\\ntion for the review, (3) a distinct structure for the review (including tasks and inter-\\nnal work products) is defined, and (4) follow-up by the reviewers occurs for any\\ncorrections that are made.\\nTo understand the reference model, let’s assume that you’ve decided to review the\\ninterface design for SafeHomeAssured.com. You can do this in a variety of different\\nways that range from relatively casual to extremely rigorous. If you decide that the\\ncasual approach is most appropriate, you ask a few colleagues (peers) to examine\\nthe interface prototype in an effort to uncover potential problems. All of you decide\\nthat there will be no advance preparation, but that you will evaluate the prototype in\\na reasonably structured way—looking at layout first, aesthetics next, navigation op-\\ntions after that, and so on.

Each per-\\nson on the team would have a specific role to play—leading the team, recording find-\\nings, presenting the material, and so on. Each reviewer would be given access to the\\nwork product (in this case, the interface prototype) before the review and would spend\\ntime looking for errors, inconsistencies, and omissions. A set of specific tasks would\\nbe conducted based on an agenda that was developed before the review occurred. The\\nresults of the review would be formally recorded, and the team would decide on the\\nstatus of the work product based on the outcome of the review. Members of the review\\nteam might also verify that the corrections made were done properly.\\nIn this book I consider two broad categories of technical reviews: informal reviews\\nand more formal technical reviews. Within each broad category, a number of differ-\\nent approaches can be chosen. These are presented in the sections that follow.\\n15.5 I NFORMAL REVIEWS\\nInformal reviews include a simple desk check of a software engineering work\\nproduct with a colleague, a casual meeting (involving more than two people) for\\nthe purpose of reviewing a work product, or the review-oriented aspects of pair\\nprogramming (Chapter 3).\\nA simple desk check or a casual meeting conducted with a colleague is a review.\\nHowever, because there is no advance planning or preparation, no agenda or meet-\\ning structure, and no follow-up on the errors that are uncovered, the effectiveness of\\nsuch reviews is considerably lower than more formal approaches. But a simple desk\\ncheck can and does uncover errors that might otherwise propagate further into the\\nsoftware process.\\nOne way to improve the efficacy of a desk check review is to develop a set of sim-\\nple review checklists for each major work product produced by the software team.\\nThe questions posed within the checklist are generic, but they will serve to guide the\\nreviewers as they check the work product. For example, let’s reexamine a desk check\\nof the interface prototype for SafeHomeAssured.com. Rather than simply playing\\nwith the prototype at the designer’s workstation, the designer and a colleague\\nexamine the prototype using a checklist for interfaces:\\n• Is the layout designed using standard conventions? Left to right? Top to\\nbottom?\\n• Does the presentation need to be scrolled?\\n• Are color and placement, typeface, and size used effectively?\\n• Are all navigation options or functions represented at the same level of\\nabstraction?\\n• Are all navigation choices clearly labeled?\\n424 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\npre75977_ch15.qxd  11/27/08  5:54 PM  Page 424'),\n",

Any errors or issues noted by the reviewers are recorded by the designer\\nfor resolution at a later time. Desk checks may be scheduled in an ad hoc manner,\\nor they may be mandated as part of good software engineering practice. In general,\\nthe amount of material to be reviewed is relatively small and the overall time spent\\non a desk check spans little more than one or two hours.\\nIn Chapter 3, I described pair programming in the following manner: “XP recom-\\nmends that two people work together at one computer workstation to create code\\nfor a story. This provides a mechanism for real-time problem solving (two heads are\\noften better than one) and real-time quality assurance.”\\nPair programming can be characterized as a continuous desk check. Rather than\\nscheduling a review at some point in time, pair programming encourages continu-\\nous review as a work product (design or code) is created. The benefit is immediate\\ndiscovery of errors and better work product quality as a consequence.\\nIn their discussion of the efficacy of pair programming, Williams and Kessler\\n[Wil00] state:\\nAnecdotal and initial statistical evidence indicates that pair programming is a powerful\\ntechnique for productively generating high quality software products. The pair works and\\nshares ideas together to tackle the complexities of software development. They continu-\\nously perform inspections on each other’s artifacts leading to the earliest, most efficient\\nform of defect removal possible. In addition, they keep each other intently focused on the\\ntask at hand.\\nSome software engineers argue that the inherent redundancy built into pair pro-\\ngramming is wasteful of resources. After all, why assign two people to a job that one\\nperson can accomplish? The answer to this question can be found in Section 15.3.2.\\nIf the quality of the work product produced as a consequence of pair programming\\nis significantly better than the work of an individual, the quality-related savings can\\nmore than justify the “redundancy” implied by pair programming.\\nCHAPTER 15 REVIEW TECHNIQUES 425\\nReview Checklists\\nEven when reviews are well organized and\\nproperly conducted, it’s not a bad idea to\\nprovide reviewers with a “crib sheet.” That is, it’s\\nworthwhile to have a checklist that provides each reviewer\\nwith the questions that should be asked about the specific\\nwork product that is undergoing review.\\nOne of the most comprehensive collections of review\\nchecklists has been developed by NASA at the Goddard\\nSpace Flight Center and is available at http://\\nsw-assurance.gsfc.nasa.gov/disciplines/\\nquality/index.php\\nOther useful technical review checklists have also been\\nproposed by:\\nProcess Impact (www.processimpact.com/\\npr_goodies.shtml)\\nSoftware Dioxide (www.softwaredioxide.com/\\nChannels/ConView.asp?id=6309)\\nMacadamian (www.macadamian.com)\\nThe Open Group Architecture Review Checklist\\n(www.opengroup.org/architecture/\\ntogaf7-doc/arch/p4/comp/clists/syseng.htm)\\nDFAS [downloadable] (www.dfas.mil/\\ntechnology/pal/ssps/docstds/spm036.doc)\\nINFO\\npre75977_ch15.qxd  11/27/08  5:54 PM  Page 425'),\n",

The objectives of an FTR are: (1) to uncover errors\\nin function, logic, or implementation for any representation of the software; (2) to\\nverify that the software under review meets its requirements; (3) to ensure that the\\nsoftware has been represented according to predefined standards; (4) to achieve\\nsoftware that is developed in a uniform manner; and (5) to make projects more man-\\nageable. In addition, the FTR serves as a training ground, enabling junior engineers\\nto observe different approaches to software analysis, design, and implementation.\\nThe FTR also serves to promote backup and continuity because a number of people\\nbecome familiar with parts of the software that they may not have otherwise seen.\\nThe FTR is actually a class of reviews that includes walkthroughs and inspections.\\nEach FTR is conducted as a meeting and will be successful only if it is properly\\nplanned, controlled, and attended. In the sections that follow, guidelines similar to\\nthose for a walkthrough are presented as a representative formal technical review.\\nIf you have interest in software inspections, as well as additional information on\\nwalkthroughs, see [Rad02], [Wie02], or [Fre90].\\n15.6.1 The Review Meeting\\nRegardless of the FTR format that is chosen, every review meeting should abide by\\nthe following constraints:\\n• Between three and five people (typically) should be involved in the review.\\n• Advance preparation should occur but should require no more than two\\nhours of work for each person.\\n• The duration of the review meeting should be less than two hours.\\nGiven these constraints, it should be obvious that an FTR focuses on a specific (and\\nsmall) part of the overall software. For example, rather than attempting to review an\\nentire design, walkthroughs are conducted for each component or small group of\\ncomponents. By narrowing the focus, the FTR has a higher likelihood of uncovering\\nerrors.\\nThe focus of the FTR is on a work product (e.g., a portion of a requirements model,\\na detailed component design, source code for a component). The individual who has\\ndeveloped the work product—the producer—informs the project leader that the work\\nproduct is complete and that a review is required. The project leader contacts a\\nreview leader, who evaluates the product for readiness, generates copies of product\\nmaterials, and distributes them to two or three reviewers for advance preparation.\\nEach reviewer is expected to spend between one and two hours reviewing the prod-\\nuct, making notes, and otherwise becoming familiar with the work. Concurrently, the\\nreview leader also reviews the product and establishes an agenda for the review\\nmeeting, which is typically scheduled for the next day.\\n426 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nuote:\\n“There is no urge\\nso great as for one\\nman to edit\\nanother man’s\\nwork.”\\nMark Twain\\nWebRef\\nThe NASA SATC\\nFormal Inspection\\nGuidebook can be\\ndownloaded from\\nsatc.gsfc.nasa\\n.gov/Documents/\\nfi/gdb/fi.pdf.\\nAn FTR focuses on a\\nrelatively small portion\\nof a work product.\\npre75977_ch15.qxd  11/27/08  5:54 PM  Page 426'),\n",

It be-\\ncomes part of the project historical record and may be distributed to the project\\nleader and other interested parties.\\nThe review issues list serves two purposes: (1) to identify problem areas within\\nthe product and (2) to serve as an action item checklist that guides the producer as\\ncorrections are made. An issues list is normally attached to the summary report.\\nYou should establish a follow-up procedure to ensure that items on the issues list\\nhave been properly corrected. Unless this is done, it is possible that issues raised can\\n“fall between the cracks.” One approach is to assign the responsibility for follow-up\\nto the review leader.\\n15.6.3 Review Guidelines\\nGuidelines for conducting formal technical reviews must be established in advance,\\ndistributed to all reviewers, agreed upon, and then followed. A review that is un-\\ncontrolled can often be worse than no review at all. The following represents a min-\\nimum set of guidelines for formal technical reviews:\\n1. Review the product, not the producer. An FTR involves people and egos. Con-\\nducted properly, the FTR should leave all participants with a warm feeling of\\nCHAPTER 15 REVIEW TECHNIQUES 427\\nIn some situations, it’s\\na good idea to have\\nsomeone other than\\nthe producer walk\\nthrough the product\\nundergoing review.\\nThis leads to a literal\\ninterpretation of the\\nwork product and\\nbetter error recogni-\\ntion.\\nDon’t point out errors\\nharshly.

Conducted improperly, the FTR can take on the aura of an\\ninquisition. Errors should be pointed out gently; the tone of the meeting\\nshould be loose and constructive; the intent should not be to embarrass or\\nbelittle. The review leader should conduct the review meeting to ensure that\\nthe proper tone and attitude are maintained and should immediately halt a\\nreview that has gotten out of control.\\n2. Set an agenda and maintain it. One of the key maladies of meetings of all\\ntypes is drift. An FTR must be kept on track and on schedule. The review\\nleader is chartered with the responsibility for maintaining the meeting sched-\\nule and should not be afraid to nudge people when drift sets in.\\n3. Limit debate and rebuttal. When an issue is raised by a reviewer, there may\\nnot be universal agreement on its impact. Rather than spending time debat-\\ning the question, the issue should be recorded for further discussion off-line.\\n4. Enunciate problem areas, but don’t attempt to solve every problem noted.A re-\\nview is not a problem-solving session. The solution of a problem can often\\nbe accomplished by the producer alone or with the help of only one other in-\\ndividual. Problem solving should be postponed until after the review meeting.\\n5. Take written notes. It is sometimes a good idea for the recorder to make notes\\non a wall board, so that wording and priorities can be assessed by other re-\\nviewers as information is recorded. Alternatively, notes may be entered di-\\nrectly into a notebook computer.\\n6. Limit the number of participants and insist upon advance preparation. Two\\nheads are better than one, but 14 are not necessarily better than 4. Keep the\\nnumber of people involved to the necessary minimum. However, all review\\nteam members must prepare in advance. Written comments should be\\nsolicited by the review leader (providing an indication that the reviewer\\nhas reviewed the material).\\n7. Develop a checklist for each product that is likely to be reviewed. A checklist\\nhelps the review leader to structure the FTR meeting and helps each reviewer\\nto focus on important issues. Checklists should be developed for analysis,\\ndesign, code, and even testing work products.\\n8. Allocate resources and schedule time for FTRs. For reviews to be effective, they\\nshould be scheduled as tasks during the software process. In addition, time\\nshould be scheduled for the inevitable modifications that will occur as the\\nresult of an FTR.\\n9. Conduct meaningful training for all reviewers. To be effective all review partici-\\npants should receive some formal training. The training should stress both\\nprocess-related issues and the human psychological side of reviews. Freed-\\nman and Weinberg [Fre90] estimate a one-month learning curve for every\\n20 people who are to participate effectively in reviews.\\n428 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nuote:\\n“A meeting is too\\noften an event in\\nwhich minutes are\\ntaken and hours\\nare wasted.”\\nAuthor unknown\\nuote:\\n“It is one of the\\nmost beautiful\\ncompensations of\\nlife, that no man\\ncan sincerely try to\\nhelp another\\nwithout helping\\nhimself.”\\nRalph Waldo\\nEmerson\\npre75977_ch15.qxd  11/27/08  5:54 PM  Page 428'),\n",

Full FTR resources are then focused only\\non those work products that are likely (based on data collected during sampling) to\\nbe error prone.\\nTo be effective, the sample-driven review process must attempt to quantify those\\nwork products that are primary targets for full FTRs. To accomplish this, the follow-\\ning steps are suggested [The01]:\\n1. Inspect a fraction a\\ni of each software work product i. Record the number of\\nfaults fi found within ai.\\n2. Develop a gross estimate of the number of faults within work product i by\\nmultiplying fi by 1/ai.\\n3. Sort the work products in descending order according to the gross estimate\\nof the number of faults in each.\\n4. Focus available review resources on those work products that have the high-\\nest estimated number of faults.\\nThe fraction of the work product that is sampled must be representative of the work\\nproduct as a whole and large enough to be meaningful to the reviewers who do the\\nsampling. As a\\ni increases, the likelihood that the sample is a valid representation of\\nthe work product also increases. However, the resources required to do sampling\\nalso increase. A software engineering team must establish the best value for a\\ni for\\nthe types of work products produced.3\\nCHAPTER 15 REVIEW TECHNIQUES 429\\n3 Thelin and his colleagues have conducted a detailed simulation that can assist in making this\\ndetermination.

The sooner an error is uncovered and\\ncorrected, the less likely that error will propagate to other software engineering work\\nproducts and amplify itself, resulting in significantly more effort to correct it.\\nTo determine whether quality control activities are working, a set of metrics\\nshould be collected. Review metrics focus on the effort required to conduct the re-\\nview and the types and severity of errors uncovered during the review. Once metrics\\ndata are collected, they can be used to assess the efficacy of the reviews you do con-\\nduct. Industry data indicates that reviews provide a significant return on investment.\\nA reference model for review formality identifies the roles people play, planning\\nand preparation, meeting structure, correction approach, and verification as the\\ncharacteristics that indicate the degree of formality with which a review is con-\\nducted. Informal reviews are casual in nature, but can still be used effectively to un-\\ncover errors.

So what do you propose?\\nJamie: I say we select those elements of the requirements\\nand design model that are most critical to SafeHome and\\nreview them.\\nVinod: But what if we miss something in a part of the\\nmodel we don’t review?\\nShakira: I read something about a sampling technique\\n[Section 15.6.4] that might help us target candidates for\\nreview. (Shakira explains the approach.)\\nJamie: Maybe … but I’m not sure we even have time to\\nsample every element of the models.\\nVinod: What do you want us to do, Doug?\\nDoug: Let’s steal something from Extreme Programming\\n[Chapter 3]. We’ll develop the elements of each model in\\npairs—two people—and conduct an informal review of\\neach as we go. We’ll then target “critical” elements for a\\nmore formal team review, but keep those reviews to a\\nminimum. That way, everything gets looked at by more\\nthan one set of eyes, but we still maintain our delivery\\ndates.\\nJamie: That means we’re going to have to revise the\\nschedule.\\nDoug: So be it.

Prior to the twentieth century, quality control was the\\nsole responsibility of the craftsperson who built a product. As time passed and mass\\nproduction techniques became commonplace, quality control became an activity\\nperformed by people other than the ones who built the product.\\nThe first formal quality assurance and control function was introduced at Bell\\nLabs in 1916 and spread rapidly throughout the manufacturing world. During the\\n1940s, more formal approaches to quality control were suggested. These relied on\\nmeasurement and continuous process improvement [Dem86] as key elements of\\nquality management.\\nToday, every company has mechanisms to ensure quality in its products. In fact,\\nexplicit statements of a company’s concern for quality have become a marketing\\nploy during the past few decades.\\nThe history of quality assurance in software development parallels the history of\\nquality in hardware manufacturing. During the early days of computing (1950s and\\n1960s), quality was the sole responsibility of the programmer. Standards for quality\\nassurance for software were introduced in military contract software development\\nduring the 1970s and have spread rapidly into software development in the com-\\nmercial world [IEE93]. Extending the definition presented earlier, software quality\\nassurance is a “planned and systematic pattern of actions” [Sch98c] that are required\\nto ensure high quality in software. The scope of quality assurance responsibility\\nmight best be characterized by paraphrasing a once-popular automobile commercial:\\n“Quality Is Job #1.” The implication for software is that many different constituencies\\nCHAPTER 16 SOFTWARE QUALITY ASSURANCE 433\\n1 If you have not read Chapter 14, you should do so now.\\nuote:\\n“You made too\\nmany wrong\\nmistakes.”\\nYogi Berra\\npre75977_ch16.qxd  11/27/08  6:07 PM  Page 433'),\n",

That is, the\\npeople who perform SQA must look at the software from the customer’s point of\\nview. Does the software adequately meet the quality factors noted in Chapter 14? Has\\nsoftware development been conducted according to preestablished standards? Have\\ntechnical disciplines properly performed their roles as part of the SQA activity? The\\nSQA group attempts to answer these and other questions to ensure that software\\nquality is maintained.\\n16.2 E LEMENTS OF SOFTWARE QUALITY ASSURANCE\\nSoftware quality assurance encompasses a broad range of concerns and activities\\nthat focus on the management of software quality. These can be summarized in the\\nfollowing manner [Hor03]:\\nStandards. The IEEE, ISO, and other standards organizations have pro-\\nduced a broad array of software engineering standards and related docu-\\nments. Standards may be adopted voluntarily by a software engineering\\norganization or imposed by the customer or other stakeholders. The job of\\nSQA is to ensure that standards that have been adopted are followed and\\nthat all work products conform to them.\\nReviews and audits. Technical reviews are a quality control activity\\nperformed by software engineers for software engineers (Chapter 15).\\nTheir intent is to uncover errors. Audits are a type of review performed by\\nSQA personnel with the intent of ensuring that quality guidelines are being\\nfollowed for software engineering work. For example, an audit of the\\nreview process might be conducted to ensure that reviews are being\\nperformed in a manner that will lead to the highest likelihood of\\nuncovering errors.\\nTesting. Software testing (Chapters 17 through 20) is a quality control func-\\ntion that has one primary goal—to find errors. The job of SQA is to ensure\\nthat testing is properly planned and efficiently conducted so that it has the\\nhighest likelihood of achieving its primary goal.\\nError/defect collection and analysis. The only way to improve is to\\nmeasure how you’re doing. SQA collects and analyzes error and defect data\\nto better understand how errors are introduced and what software engineer-\\ning activities are best suited to eliminating them.\\nChange management. Change is one of the most disruptive aspects of\\nany software project. If it is not properly managed, change can lead to con-\\nfusion, and confusion almost always leads to poor quality. SQA ensures that\\nadequate change management practices (Chapter 22) have been instituted.\\nWebRef\\nAn in-depth discussion\\nof SQA, including\\na wide array of\\ndefinitions, can\\nbe obtained at\\nwww.swqual\\n.com/newsletter/\\nvol2/no1/\\nvol2no1.html.\\npre75977_ch16.qxd  11/27/08  6:07 PM  Page 434'),\n",

Every software organization wants to improve its software\\nengineering practices. A key contributor to improvement is education of soft-\\nware engineers, their managers, and other stakeholders. The SQA organiza-\\ntion takes the lead in software process improvement (Chapter 30) and is a\\nkey proponent and sponsor of educational programs.\\nVendor management. Three categories of software are acquired from\\nexternal software vendors— shrink-wrapped packages (e.g., Microsoft Office),\\na tailored shell [Hor03] that provides a basic skeletal structure that is custom\\ntailored to the needs of a purchaser, and contracted software that is custom\\ndesigned and constructed from specifications provided by the customer\\norganization. The job of the SQA organization is to ensure that high-quality\\nsoftware results by suggesting specific quality practices that the vendor\\nshould follow (when possible), and incorporating quality mandates as part of\\nany contract with an external vendor.\\nSecurity management. With the increase in cyber crime and new govern-\\nment regulations regarding privacy, every software organization should insti-\\ntute policies that protect data at all levels, establish firewall protection for\\nWebApps, and ensure that software has not been tampered with internally.\\nSQA ensures that appropriate process and technology are used to achieve\\nsoftware security.\\nSafety. Because software is almost always a pivotal component of human-\\nrated systems (e.g., automotive or aircraft applications), the impact of hidden\\ndefects can be catastrophic.

Source code and related work products (e.g., other descrip-\\ntive information) must conform to local coding standards and exhibit charac-\\nteristics that will facilitate maintainability. SQA should isolate those attributes\\nthat allow a reasonable analysis of the quality of code.\\nQuality control effectiveness.

Originally popularized by Motorola in the 1980s, the Six Sigma strategy\\n“is a rigorous and disciplined methodology that uses data and statistical analysis to\\nmeasure and improve a company’s operational performance by identifying and elim-\\ninating defects’ in manufacturing and service-related processes” [ISI08]. The term\\nSix Sigma is derived from six standard deviations—3.4 instances (defects) per million\\noccurrences—implying an extremely high quality standard. The Six Sigma method-\\nology defines three core steps:\\n• Define customer requirements and deliverables and project goals via well-\\ndefined methods of customer communication.\\n• Measure the existing process and its output to determine current quality\\nperformance (collect defect metrics).\\n• Analyze defect metrics and determine the vital few causes.\\nIf an existing software process is in place, but improvement is required, Six Sigma\\nsuggests two additional steps:\\n• Improve the process by eliminating the root causes of defects.\\n• Control the process to ensure that future work does not reintroduce the\\ncauses of defects.\\nThese core and additional steps are sometimes referred to as the DMAIC (define,\\nmeasure, analyze, improve, and control) method.\\nIf an organization is developing a software process (rather than improving an\\nexisting process), the core steps are augmented as follows:\\n• Design the process to (1) avoid the root causes of defects and (2) to meet\\ncustomer requirements.\\n• Verify that the process model will, in fact, avoid defects and meet customer\\nrequirements.\\nThis variation is sometimes called the DMADV (define, measure, analyze, design,\\nand verify) method.\\nA comprehensive discussion of Six Sigma is best left to resources dedicated to the\\nsubject.

If a program repeatedly and frequently fails to perform, it mat-\\nters little whether other software quality factors are acceptable.\\nSoftware reliability, unlike many other quality factors, can be measured directly\\nand estimated using historical and developmental data. Software reliabilityis defined\\nin statistical terms as “the probability of failure-free operation of a computer program\\nin a specified environment for a specified time” [Mus87]. To illustrate, program X is\\nestimated to have a reliability of 0.999 over eight elapsed processing hours. In other\\nwords, if program Xwere to be executed 1000 times and require a total of eight hours\\nof elapsed processing time (execution time), it is likely to operate correctly (without\\nfailure) 999 times.\\nWhenever software reliability is discussed, a pivotal question arises: What is meant\\nby the term failure? In the context of any discussion of software quality and reliabil-\\nity, failure is nonconformance to software requirements. Yet, even within this defini-\\ntion, there are gradations. Failures can be only annoying or catastrophic. One failure\\ncan be corrected within seconds, while another requires weeks or even months to\\ncorrect. Complicating the issue even further, the correction of one failure may in fact\\nresult in the introduction of other errors that ultimately result in other failures.\\n16.6.1 Measures of Reliability and Availability\\nEarly work in software reliability attempted to extrapolate the mathematics of hard-\\nware reliability theory to the prediction of software reliability. Most hardware-related\\nreliability models are predicated on failure due to wear rather than failure due to de-\\nsign defects. In hardware, failures due to physical wear (e.g., the effects of tempera-\\nture, corrosion, shock) are more likely than a design-related failure. Unfortunately,\\nthe opposite is true for software. In fact, all software failures can be traced to design\\nor implementation problems; wear (see Chapter 1) does not enter into the picture.\\nThere has been an ongoing debate over the relationship between key concepts in\\nhardware reliability and their applicability to software. Although an irrefutable link\\nhas yet to be established, it is worthwhile to consider a few simple concepts that\\napply to both system elements.\\nIf we consider a computer-based system, a simple measure of reliability is mean-\\ntime-between-failure (MTBF):\\nMTBF /H11005MTTF /H11001MTTR\\nwhere the acronyms MTTF and MTTR are mean-time-to-failure and mean-time-to-\\nrepair,\\n2 respectively.\\n442 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nuote:\\n“The unavoidable\\nprice of reliability\\nis simplicity.”\\nC.

Stated simply, an end user\\nis concerned with failures, not with the total defect count. Because each defect con-\\ntained within a program does not have the same failure rate, the total defect count\\nprovides little indication of the reliability of a system. For example, consider a pro-\\ngram that has been in operation for 3000 processor hours without failure. Many de-\\nfects in this program may remain undetected for tens of thousand of hours before\\nthey are discovered. The MTBF of such obscure errors might be 30,000 or even\\n60,000 processor hours. Other defects, as yet undiscovered, might have a failure rate\\nof 4000 or 5000 hours. Even if every one of the first category of errors (those with\\nlong MTBF) is removed, the impact on software reliability is negligible.\\nHowever, MTBF can be problematic for two reasons: (1) it projects a time span be-\\ntween failures, but does not provide us with a projected failure rate, and (2) MTBF can\\nbe misinterpreted to mean average life span even though this is notwhat it implies.\\nAn alternative measure of reliability is failures-in-time(FIT)—a statistical measure\\nof how many failures a component will have over one billion hours of operation.\\nTherefore, 1 FIT is equivalent to one failure in every billion hours of operation.\\nIn addition to a reliability measure, you should also develop a measure of avail-\\nability. Software availability is the probability that a program is operating according to\\nrequirements at a given point in time and is defined as\\nAvailability /H11005/H11003  100%\\nThe MTBF reliability measure is equally sensitive to MTTF and MTTR. The avail-\\nability measure is somewhat more sensitive to MTTR, an indirect measure of the\\nmaintainability of software.\\n16.6.2 Software Safety\\nSoftware safetyis a software quality assurance activity that focuses on the identification\\nand assessment of potential hazards that may affect software negatively and cause an\\nentire system to fail. If hazards can be identified early in the software process, software\\ndesign features can be specified that will either eliminate or control potential hazards.\\nA modeling and analysis process is conducted as part of software safety. Initially,\\nhazards are identified and categorized by criticality and risk. For example, some of\\nthe hazards associated with a computer-based cruise control for an automobile\\nmight be: (1) causes uncontrolled acceleration that cannot be stopped, (2) does not\\nrespond to depression of brake pedal (by turning off), (3) does not engage when\\nswitch is activated, and (4) slowly loses or gains speed. Once these system-level haz-\\nards are identified, analysis techniques are used to assign severity and probability of\\noccurrence.\\n3 To be effective, software must be analyzed in the context of the entire\\nMTTF\\nMTTF /H11001MTTR\\nCHAPTER 16 SOFTWARE QUALITY ASSURANCE 443\\nSome aspects of\\navailability (not\\ndiscussed here) have\\nnothing to do with\\nfailure.

If and only if a set of external environmental conditions is met,\\nthe improper position of the mechanical device will cause a disastrous failure. Analy-\\nsis techniques [Eri05] such as fault tree analysis, real-time logic, and Petri net mod-\\nels can be used to predict the chain of events that can cause hazards and the\\nprobability that each of the events will occur to create the chain.\\nOnce hazards are identified and analyzed, safety-related requirements can be\\nspecified for the software.

Upon successful registration,\\na company is issued a certificate from a registration body represented by the auditors.\\nSemiannual surveillance audits ensure continued compliance to the standard.\\n444 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nuote:\\n“I cannot imagine\\nany condition\\nwhich would\\ncause this ship to\\nfounder.

SQA encompasses procedures for the effective\\napplication of methods and tools, oversight of quality control activities such as tech-\\nnical reviews and software testing, procedures for change management, procedures\\nfor assuring compliance to standards, and measurement and reporting mechanisms.\\nTo properly conduct software quality assurance, data about the software engi-\\nneering process should be collected, evaluated, and disseminated.

But how do you conduct\\nthe tests? Should you develop a formal plan for\\nyour tests? Should you test the entire program as\\na whole or run tests only on a small part of it?\\nShould you rerun tests you’ve already conducted\\nas you add new components to a large system?\\nWhen should you involve the customer? These\\nand many other questions are answered when\\nyou develop a software testing strategy.\\nWho does it? A strategy for software testing is\\ndeveloped by the project manager, software\\nengineers, and testing specialists.\\nWhy is it important? Testing often accounts for\\nmore project effort than any other software engi-\\nneering action. If it is conducted haphazardly,\\ntime is wasted, unnecessary effort is expended,\\nand even worse, errors sneak through undetected.\\nIt would therefore seem reasonable to establish\\na systematic strategy for testing software.\\nWhat are the steps? Testing begins “in the small”\\nand progresses “to the large.” By this I mean\\nQUICK\\nLOOK\\nthat early testing focuses on a single component\\nor a small group of related components and\\napplies tests to uncover errors in the data and\\nprocessing logic that have been encapsulated\\nby the component(s). After components are\\ntested they must be integrated until the complete\\nsystem is constructed. At this point, a series of\\nhigh-order tests are executed to uncover errors\\nin meeting customer requirements. As errors are\\nuncovered, they must be diagnosed and cor-\\nrected using a process that is called debugging.\\nWhat is the work product?

We are now in an era in which modern design techniques [and tech-\\nnical reviews] are helping us to reduce the number of initial errors that are inherent in the\\ncode.

In Chapters 18 through 20, the testing methods and tech-\\nniques that implement the strategy are presented.\\n17.1 A S TRATEGIC APPROACH TO SOFTWARE TESTING\\nTesting is a set of activities that can be planned in advance and conducted system-\\natically. For this reason a template for software testing—a set of steps into which you\\ncan place specific test case design techniques and testing methods—should be\\ndefined for the software process.\\nA number of software testing strategies have been proposed in the literature.\\nAll provide you with a template for testing and all have the following generic\\ncharacteristics:\\n• To perform effective testing, you should conduct effective technical reviews\\n(Chapter 15). By doing this, many errors will be eliminated before testing\\ncommences.\\n• Testing begins at the component level and works “outward” toward the\\nintegration of the entire computer-based system.\\n• Different testing techniques are appropriate for different software engi-\\nneering approaches and at different points in time.\\n• Testing is conducted by the developer of the software and (for large projects)\\nan independent test group.\\n• Testing and debugging are different activities, but debugging must be accom-\\nmodated in any testing strategy.\\nA strategy for software testing must accommodate low-level tests that are neces-\\nsary to verify that a small source code segment has been correctly implemented\\nas well as high-level tests that validate major system functions against customer\\nrequirements. A strategy should provide guidance for the practitioner and a set of\\nmilestones for the manager. Because the steps of the test strategy occur at a time\\nwhen deadline pressure begins to rise, progress must be measurable and problems\\nshould surface as early as possible.\\n17.1.1 Verification and Validation\\nSoftware testing is one element of a broader topic that is often referred to as verifi-\\ncation and validation (V&V).

Validation refers to a different set\\nof tasks that ensure that the software that has been built is traceable to customer\\nrequirements. Boehm [Boe81] states this another way:\\nVerification: “Are we building the product right?”\\nValidation: “Are we building the right product?”\\nThe definition of V&V encompasses many software quality assurance activities\\n(Chapter 16).1\\nVerification and validation includes a wide array of SQA activities: technical\\nreviews, quality and configuration audits, performance monitoring, simulation, feasi-\\nbility study, documentation review, database review, algorithm analysis, development\\ntesting, usability testing, qualification testing, acceptance testing, and installation test-\\ning. Although testing plays an extremely important role in V&V, many other activities\\nare also necessary.\\nTesting does provide the last bastion from which quality can be assessed and,\\nmore pragmatically, errors can be uncovered. But testing should not be viewed as a\\nsafety net. As they say, “You can’t test in quality. If it’s not there before you begin test-\\ning, it won’t be there when you’re finished testing.” Quality is incorporated into soft-\\nware throughout the process of software engineering. Proper application of methods\\nand tools, effective technical reviews, and solid management and measurement all\\nlead to quality that is confirmed during testing.\\nMiller [Mil77] relates software testing to quality assurance by stating that “the\\nunderlying motivation of program testing is to affirm software quality with methods\\nthat can be economically and effectively applied to both large-scale and small-scale\\nsystems.”\\n17.1.2 Organizing for Software Testing\\nFor every software project, there is an inherent conflict of interest that occurs as\\ntesting begins. The people who have built the software are now asked to test the soft-\\nware. This seems harmless in itself; after all, who knows the program better than its\\ndevelopers? Unfortunately, these same developers have a vested interest in demon-\\nstrating that the program is error-free, that it works according to customer require-\\nments, and that it will be completed on schedule and within budget. Each of these\\ninterests mitigate against thorough testing.\\nFrom a psychological point of view, software analysis and design (along with\\ncoding) are constructive tasks. The software engineer analyzes, models, and then\\ncreates a computer program and its documentation. Like any builder, the software\\nCHAPTER 17 SOFTWARE TESTING STRATEGIES 451\\nuote:\\n“Testing is the\\nunavoidable part\\nof any responsible\\neffort to develop a\\nsoftware system.”\\nWilliam Howden\\nDon’t get sloppy and\\nview testing as a\\n“safety net” that will\\ncatch all errors that\\noccurred because of\\nweak software engi-\\nneering practices.

Other people view unit and integration testing (Sections 17.3.1 and 17.3.2) as verification\\nand higher-order testing (Sections 17.6 and 17.7) as validation.\\nuote:\\n“Optimism is the\\noccupational\\nhazard of\\nprogramming;\\ntesting is the\\ntreatment.”\\nKent Beck\\npre75977_ch17.qxd  11/27/08  6:09 PM  Page 451'),\n",

So the builder treads lightly, designing and executing tests that will\\ndemonstrate that the program works, rather than uncovering errors. Unfortunately,\\nerrors will be present. And, if the software engineer doesn’t find them, the cus-\\ntomer will!\\nThere are often a number of misconceptions that you might infer erroneously\\nfrom the preceding discussion: (1) that the developer of software should do no test-\\ning at all, (2) that the software should be “tossed over the wall” to strangers who will\\ntest it mercilessly, (3) that testers get involved with the project only when the testing\\nsteps are about to begin. Each of these statements is incorrect.\\nThe software developer is always responsible for testing the individual units\\n(components) of the program, ensuring that each performs the function or exhibits\\nthe behavior for which it was designed. In many cases, the developer also conducts\\nintegration testing—a testing step that leads to the construction (and test) of the\\ncomplete software architecture. Only after the software architecture is complete\\ndoes an independent test group become involved.\\nThe role of an independent test group (ITG) is to remove the inherent problems\\nassociated with letting the builder test the thing that has been built. Independent\\ntesting removes the conflict of interest that may otherwise be present.

The developer\\nand the ITG work closely throughout a software project to ensure that thorough tests\\nwill be conducted. While testing is conducted, the developer must be available to\\ncorrect errors that are uncovered.\\nThe ITG is part of the software development project team in the sense that it\\nbecomes involved during analysis and design and stays involved (planning and spec-\\nifying test procedures) throughout a large project. However, in many cases the ITG\\nreports to the software quality assurance organization, thereby achieving a degree\\nof independence that might not be possible if it were a part of the software engi-\\nneering organization.\\n17.1.3 Software Testing Strategy—The Big Picture\\nThe software process may be viewed as the spiral illustrated in Figure 17.1.

This sobering fact underlines the\\nimportance of other software quality assurance activities. Another response (some-\\nwhat cynical but nonetheless accurate) is: “You’re done testing when you run out of\\ntime or you run out of money.”\\nAlthough few practitioners would argue with these responses, you need more rig-\\norous criteria for determining when sufficient testing has been conducted. The\\ncleanroom software engineering approach (Chapter 21) suggests statistical use tech-\\nniques [Kel00] that execute a series of tests derived from a statistical sample of all\\npossible program executions by all users from a targeted population. Others (e.g.,\\n[Sin99]) advocate using statistical modeling and software reliability theory to predict\\nthe completeness of testing.\\nBy collecting metrics during software testing and making use of existing software\\nreliability models, it is possible to develop meaningful guidelines for answering the\\nquestion: “When are we done testing?” There is little debate that further work\\nremains to be done before quantitative rules for testing can be established, but the\\nempirical approaches that currently exist are considerably better than raw intuition.\\n17.2 S TRATEGIC ISSUES\\nLater in this chapter, I present a systematic strategy for software testing. But even the\\nbest strategy will fail if a series of overriding issues are not addressed. Tom Gilb\\n[Gil95] argues that a software testing strategy will succeed when software testers:\\nSpecify product requirements in a quantifiable manner long before testing com-\\nmences. Although the overriding objective of testing is to find errors, a good testing\\nstrategy also assesses other quality characteristics such as portability, maintain-\\nability, and usability (Chapter 14). These should be specified in a way that is meas-\\nurable so that testing results are unambiguous.\\nState testing objectives explicitly. The specific objectives of testing should be\\nstated in measurable terms. For example, test effectiveness, test coverage, mean-\\ntime-to-failure, the cost to find and fix defects, remaining defect density or fre-\\nquency of occurrence, and test work-hours should be stated within the test plan.\\nUnderstand the users of the software and develop a profile for each user category.\\nUse cases that describe the interaction scenario for each class of user can reduce\\noverall testing effort by focusing testing on actual use of the product.\\nCHAPTER 17 SOFTWARE TESTING STRATEGIES 455\\nWhen are\\nwe finished\\ntesting?\\n?\\nWebRef\\nA comprehensive\\nglossary of testing terms\\ncan be found atwww\\n.testingstandards\\n.co.uk/living_\\nglossary.htm.\\nWhat\\nguidelines\\nlead to a\\nsuccessful\\nsoftware testing\\nstrategy?\\n?\\nWebRef\\nAn excellent list of\\ntesting resources can\\nbe found at www\\n.io.com/~wazmo/\\nqa/.\\npre75977_ch17.qxd  11/27/08  6:09 PM  Page 455'),\n",

At one extreme, you can\\nwait until the system is fully constructed and then conduct tests on the overall sys-\\ntem in hopes of finding errors. This approach, although appealing, simply does not\\nwork. It will result in buggy software that disappoints all stakeholders. At the other\\nextreme, you could conduct tests on a daily basis, whenever any part of the system\\nis constructed. This approach, although less appealing to many, can be very effec-\\ntive. Unfortunately, some software developers hesitate to use it. What to do?\\nA testing strategy that is chosen by most software teams falls between the two\\nextremes. It takes an incremental view of testing, beginning with the testing of indi-\\nvidual program units, moving to tests designed to facilitate the integration of the\\nunits, and culminating with tests that exercise the constructed system. Each of these\\nclasses of tests is described in the sections that follow.\\n17.3.1 Unit Testing\\nUnit testing focuses verification effort on the smallest unit of software design—the\\nsoftware component or module.

Unit tests are illustrated schematically in Figure 17.3.\\nThe module interface is tested to ensure that information properly flows into and out\\nof the program unit under test. Local data structures are examined to ensure that\\ndata stored temporarily maintains its integrity during all steps in an algorithm’s\\nexecution. All independent paths through the control structure are exercised to ensure\\nthat all statements in a module have been executed at least once.

And finally, all error-handling paths are tested.\\nData flow across a component interface is tested before any other testing is initi-\\nated. If data do not enter and exit properly, all other tests are moot. In addition, local\\ndata structures should be exercised and the local impact on global data should be as-\\ncertained (if possible) during unit testing.\\nSelective testing of execution paths is an essential task during the unit test. Test\\ncases should be designed to uncover errors due to erroneous computations, incor-\\nrect comparisons, or improper control flow.\\nBoundary testing is one of the most important unit testing tasks.

Data can be lost across an interface; one component can\\nhave an inadvertent, adverse effect on another; subfunctions, when combined, may\\nnot produce the desired major function; individually acceptable imprecision may be\\nmagnified to unacceptable levels; global data structures can present problems.\\nSadly, the list goes on and on.\\nIntegration testing is a systematic technique for constructing the software archi-\\ntecture while at the same time conducting tests to uncover errors associated with\\ninterfacing. The objective is to take unit-tested components and build a program\\nstructure that has been dictated by design.\\nThere is often a tendency to attempt nonincremental integration; that is, to con-\\nstruct the program using a “big bang” approach. All components are combined in\\nadvance. The entire program is tested as a whole. And chaos usually results! A set\\nof errors is encountered. Correction is difficult because isolation of causes is com-\\nplicated by the vast expanse of the entire program.

Therefore, the regression test suite should be designed to include only those\\ntests that address one or more classes of errors in each of the major program func-\\ntions. It is impractical and inefficient to reexecute every test for every program func-\\ntion once a change has occurred.\\nSmoke testing. Smoke testing is an integration testing approach that is com-\\nmonly used when product software is developed. It is designed as a pacing mecha-\\nnism for time-critical projects, allowing the software team to assess the project on\\na frequent basis. In essence, the smoke-testing approach encompasses the follow-\\ning activities:\\n1. Software components that have been translated into code are integrated into\\na build. A build includes all data files, libraries, reusable modules, and engi-\\nneered components that are required to implement one or more product\\nfunctions.\\n2. A series of tests is designed to expose errors that will keep the build from\\nproperly performing its function. The intent should be to uncover “show-\\nstopper” errors that have the highest likelihood of throwing the software\\nproject behind schedule.\\n3. The build is integrated with other builds, and the entire product (in its current\\nform) is smoke tested daily. The integration approach may be top down or\\nbottom up.\\nThe daily frequency of testing the entire product may surprise some readers. How-\\never, frequent tests give both managers and practitioners a realistic assessment of\\nintegration testing progress. McConnell [McC96] describes the smoke test in the\\nfollowing manner:\\nThe smoke test should exercise the entire system from end to end. It does not have to be\\nexhaustive, but it should be capable of exposing major problems. The smoke test should\\nbe thorough enough that if the build passes, you can assume that it is stable enough to\\nbe tested more thoroughly.\\nSmoke testing provides a number of benefits when it is applied on complex, time-\\ncritical software projects:\\n• Integration risk is minimized. Because smoke tests are conducted daily,\\nincompatibilities and other show-stopper errors are uncovered early, thereby\\nreducing the likelihood of serious schedule impact when errors are\\nuncovered.\\n• The quality of the end product is improved. Because the approach is construc-\\ntion (integration) oriented, smoke testing is likely to uncover functional\\nerrors as well as architectural and component-level design errors. If these\\nerrors are corrected early, better product quality will result.\\nCHAPTER 17 SOFTWARE TESTING STRATEGIES 463\\nSmoke testing might\\nbe characterized as a\\nrolling integration\\nstrategy.

Like all integration testing\\napproaches, errors uncovered during smoke testing are likely to be associ-\\nated with “new software increments”—that is, the software that has just been\\nadded to the build(s) is a probable cause of a newly discovered error.\\n• Progress is easier to assess.With each passing day, more of the software has\\nbeen integrated and more has been demonstrated to work. This improves team\\nmorale and gives managers a good indication that progress is being made.\\nStrategic options. There has been much discussion (e.g., [Bei84]) about the rela-\\ntive advantages and disadvantages of top-down versus bottom-up integration test-\\ning. In general, the advantages of one strategy tend to result in disadvantages for the\\nother strategy. The major disadvantage of the top-down approach is the need for\\nstubs and the attendant testing difficulties that can be associated with them. Prob-\\nlems associated with stubs may be offset by the advantage of testing major control\\nfunctions early. The major disadvantage of bottom-up integration is that “the pro-\\ngram as an entity does not exist until the last module is added” [Mye79]. This draw-\\nback is tempered by easier test case design and a lack of stubs.\\nSelection of an integration strategy depends upon software characteristics and,\\nsometimes, project schedule. In general, a combined approach (sometimes called\\nsandwich testing) that uses top-down tests for upper levels of the program structure,\\ncoupled with bottom-up tests for subordinate levels may be the best compromise.\\nAs integration testing is conducted, the tester should identify critical modules. A\\ncritical module has one or more of the following characteristics: (1) addresses several\\nsoftware requirements, (2) has a high level of control (resides relatively high in the\\nprogram structure), (3) is complex or error prone, or (4) has definite performance\\nrequirements. Critical modules should be tested as early as is possible. In addition,\\nregression tests should focus on critical module function.\\nIntegration test work products. An overall plan for integration of the software\\nand a description of specific tests is documented in aTest Specification.This work prod-\\nuct incorporates a test plan and a test procedure and becomes part of the software\\nconfiguration. Testing is divided into phases and builds that address specific func-\\ntional and behavioral characteristics of the software. For example, integration testing\\nfor the SafeHome security system might be divided into the following test phases:\\n• User interaction (command input and output, display representation, error\\nprocessing and representation)\\n• Sensor processing (acquisition of sensor output, determination of sensor\\nconditions, actions required as a consequence of conditions)\\n• Communications functions (ability to communicate with central monitoring\\nstation)\\n• Alarm processing (tests of software actions that occur when an alarm is\\nencountered)\\n464 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nWebRef\\nPointers to commentary\\non testing strategies\\ncan be found at\\nwww.qalinks.com.\\nWhat is a\\n“critical\\nmodule” and\\nwhy should we\\nidentify it?\\n?\\npre75977_ch17.qxd  11/27/08  6:09 PM  Page 464'),\n",

This means that each class\\nand each instance of a class packages attributes (data) and the operations that\\nmanipulate these data. An encapsulated class is usually the focus of unit testing. How-\\never, operations (methods) within the class are the smallest testable units. Because a\\nclass can contain a number of different operations, and a particular operation may\\nexist as part of a number of different classes, the tactics applied to unit testing must\\nchange.\\nYou can no longer test a single operation in isolation (the conventional view of\\nunit testing) but rather as part of a class. To illustrate, consider a class hierarchy in\\nwhich an operation X is defined for the superclass and is inherited by a number of\\nsubclasses. Each subclass uses operation X, but it is applied within the context of the\\nprivate attributes and operations that have been defined for the subclass. Because\\nthe context in which operation X is used varies in subtle ways, it is necessary to test\\noperation X in the context of each of the subclasses. This means that testing opera-\\ntion X in a stand-alone fashion (the conventional unit-testing approach) is usually\\nineffective in the object-oriented context.\\nClass testing for OO software is the equivalent of unit testing for conventional\\nsoftware. Unlike unit testing of conventional software, which tends to focus on the\\nalgorithmic detail of a module and the data that flow across the module interface,\\nclass testing for OO software is driven by the operations encapsulated by the class\\nand the state behavior of the class.\\n17.4.2 Integration Testing in the OO Context\\nBecause object-oriented software does not have an obvious hierarchical control\\nstructure, traditional top-down and bottom-up integration strategies (Section 17.3.2)\\nhave little meaning. In addition, integrating operations one at a time into a class (the\\nconventional incremental integration approach) is often impossible because of the\\n“direct and indirect interactions of the components that make up the class” [Ber93].\\nThere are two different strategies for integration testing of OO systems [Bin94b].\\nThe first, thread-based testing,integrates the set of classes required to respond to one\\ninput or event for the system. Each thread is integrated and tested individually.\\nRegression testing is applied to ensure that no side effects occur. The second inte-\\ngration approach, use-based testing, begins the construction of the system by testing\\nthose classes (called independent classes ) that use very few (if any) server classes.\\nAfter the independent classes are tested, the next layer of classes, called dependent\\nclasses, that use the independent classes are tested. This sequence of testing layers\\nof dependent classes continues until the entire system is constructed.\\nThe use of drivers and stubs also changes when integration testing of OO systems\\nis conducted. Drivers can be used to test operations at the lowest level and for the\\ntesting of whole groups of classes. A driver can also be used to replace the user inter-\\nface so that tests of system functionality can be conducted prior to implementation\\n466 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nClass testing for OO\\nsoftware is analogous to\\nmodule testing for\\nconventional software. It\\nis not advisable to test\\noperations in isolation.\\nAn important strategy\\nfor integration testing\\nof OO software is\\nthread-based testing.\\nThreads are sets of\\nclasses that respond to\\nan input or event.

The\\nfollowing steps summarize the approach:\\n1. The content model for the WebApp is reviewed to uncover errors.\\n2. The interface model is reviewed to ensure that all use cases can be\\naccommodated.\\n3. The design model for the WebApp is reviewed to uncover navigation errors.\\n4. The user interface is tested to uncover errors in presentation and/or naviga-\\ntion mechanics.\\n5. Each functional component is unit tested.\\n6. Navigation throughout the architecture is tested.\\n7. The WebApp is implemented in a variety of different environmental configu-\\nrations and is tested for compatibility with each configuration.\\n8. Security tests are conducted in an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the\\nWebApp or within its environment.\\n9. Performance tests are conducted.\\n10. The WebApp is tested by a controlled and monitored population of end users.\\nThe results of their interaction with the system are evaluated for content and\\nnavigation errors, usability concerns, compatibility concerns, and WebApp\\nreliability and performance.\\nBecause many WebApps evolve continuously, the testing process is an ongoing\\nactivity, conducted by support staff who use regression tests derived from the tests\\ndeveloped when the WebApp was first engineered.

At this point a battle-hardened software developer\\nmight protest: “Who or what is the arbiter of reasonable expectations?” If a Software\\nRequirements Specification has been developed, it describes all user-visible attributes\\nof the software and contains a Validation Criteria section that forms the basis for a\\nvalidation-testing approach.\\n17.6.1 Validation-Test Criteria\\nSoftware validation is achieved through a series of tests that demonstrate conform-\\nity with requirements. A test plan outlines the classes of tests to be conducted, and\\na test procedure defines specific test cases that are designed to ensure that all func-\\ntional requirements are satisfied, all behavioral characteristics are achieved, all con-\\ntent is accurate and properly presented, all performance requirements are attained,\\ndocumentation is correct, and usability and other requirements are met (e.g., trans-\\nportability, compatibility, error recovery, maintainability).\\nAfter each validation test case has been conducted, one of two possible condi-\\ntions exists: (1) The function or performance characteristic conforms to specification\\nand is accepted or (2) a deviation from specification is uncovered and a deficiency\\nlist is created. Deviations or errors discovered at this stage in a project can rarely be\\ncorrected prior to scheduled delivery. It is often necessary to negotiate with the cus-\\ntomer to establish a method for resolving deficiencies.\\n17.6.2 Configuration Review\\nAn important element of the validation process is a configuration review. The intent\\nof the review is to ensure that all elements of the software configuration have been\\nproperly developed, are cataloged, and have the necessary detail to bolster the sup-\\nport activities. The configuration review, sometimes called an audit, is discussed in\\nmore detail in Chapter 22.\\n17.6.3 Alpha and Beta Testing\\nIt is virtually impossible for a software developer to foresee how the customer will\\nreally use a program. Instructions for use may be misinterpreted; strange combina-\\ntions of data may be regularly used; output that seemed clear to the tester may be\\nunintelligible to a user in the field.\\nWhen custom software is built for one customer, a series of acceptance tests are\\nconducted to enable the customer to validate all requirements. Conducted by the end\\nuser rather than software engineers, an acceptance test can range from an informal\\n“test drive” to a planned and systematically executed series of tests.

Ultimately, software is incorporated with other sys-\\ntem elements (e.g., hardware, people, information), and a series of system integra-\\ntion and validation tests are conducted. These tests fall outside the scope of the\\nsoftware process and are not conducted solely by software engineers. However,\\nsteps taken during software design and testing can greatly improve the probability\\nof successful software integration in the larger system.\\nA classic system-testing problem is “finger pointing.” This occurs when an error\\nis uncovered, and the developers of different system elements blame each other for\\nthe problem. Rather than indulging in such nonsense, you should anticipate poten-\\ntial interfacing problems and (1) design error-handling paths that test all information\\ncoming from other elements of the system, (2) conduct a series of tests that simulate\\nbad data or other potential errors at the software interface, (3) record the results of\\ntests to use as “evidence” if finger pointing does occur, and (4) participate in plan-\\nning and design of system tests to ensure that software is adequately tested.\\nSystem testing is actually a series of different tests whose primary purpose is to\\nfully exercise the computer-based system. Although each test has a different pur-\\npose, all work to verify that system elements have been properly integrated and per-\\nform allocated functions. In the sections that follow, I discuss the types of system\\ntests that are worthwhile for software-based systems.\\n17.7.1 Recovery Testing\\nMany computer-based systems must recover from faults and resume processing\\nwith little or no downtime. In some cases, a system must be fault tolerant; that is,\\nprocessing faults must not cause overall system function to cease. In other cases, a\\nsystem failure must be corrected within a specified period of time or severe eco-\\nnomic damage will occur.\\nRecovery testing is a system test that forces the software to fail in a variety of ways\\nand verifies that recovery is properly performed.

Stress tests are designed to confront programs with\\nabnormal situations. In essence, the tester who performs stress testing asks: “How\\nhigh can we crank this up before it fails?”\\nStress testing executes a system in a manner that demands resources in abnor-\\nmal quantity, frequency, or volume. For example, (1) special tests may be designed\\nthat generate ten interrupts per second, when one or two is the average rate,\\n(2) input data rates may be increased by an order of magnitude to determine how\\ninput functions will respond, (3) test cases that require maximum memory or other\\nresources are executed, (4) test cases that may cause thrashing in a virtual oper-\\nating system are designed, (5) test cases that may cause excessive hunting for\\ndisk-resident data are created. Essentially, the tester attempts to break the\\nprogram.\\nA variation of stress testing is a technique called sensitivity testing. In some situa-\\ntions (the most common occur in mathematical algorithms), a very small range of\\ndata contained within the bounds of valid data for a program may cause extreme and\\neven erroneous processing or profound performance degradation. Sensitivity testing\\nattempts to uncover data combinations within valid input classes that may cause\\ninstability or improper processing.\\n17.7.4 Performance Testing\\nFor real-time and embedded systems, software that provides required function but\\ndoes not conform to performance requirements is unacceptable.

Test-\\ncase design can be conducted, a strategy can be defined, and results can be evalu-\\nated against prescribed expectations.\\nDebugging occurs as a consequence of successful testing. That is, when a test\\ncase uncovers an error, debugging is the process that results in the removal of the\\nerror. Although debugging can and should be an orderly process, it is still very much\\nan art. As a software engineer, you are often confronted with a “symptomatic” indi-\\ncation of a software problem as you evaluate the results of a test. That is, the exter-\\nnal manifestation of the error and its internal cause may have no obvious\\nrelationship to one another. The poorly understood mental process that connects a\\nsymptom to a cause is debugging.\\n17.8.1 The Debugging Process\\nDebugging is not testing but often occurs as a consequence of testing.5 Referring to\\nFigure 17.7, the debugging process begins with the execution of a test case. Results\\nare assessed and a lack of correspondence between expected and actual perform-\\nance is encountered. In many cases, the noncorresponding data are a symptom of\\nan underlying cause as yet hidden. The debugging process attempts to match symp-\\ntom with cause, thereby leading to error correction.\\nThe debugging process will usually have one of two outcomes: (1) the cause will\\nbe found and corrected or (2) the cause will not be found. In the latter case, the per-\\nson performing debugging may suspect a cause, design a test case to help validate\\nthat suspicion, and work toward error correction in an iterative fashion.\\nWhy is debugging so difficult? In all likelihood, human psychology (see Sec-\\ntion 17.8.2) has more to do with an answer than software technology. However, a\\nfew characteristics of bugs provide some clues:\\n1. The symptom and the cause may be geographically remote. That is, the\\nsymptom may appear in one part of a program, while the cause may actually\\nbe located at a site that is far removed. Highly coupled components\\n(Chapter 8) exacerbate this situation.\\n2. The symptom may disappear (temporarily) when another error is corrected.\\n3. The symptom may actually be caused by nonerrors (e.g., round-off\\ninaccuracies).\\n4. The symptom may be caused by human error that is not easily traced.\\nCHAPTER 17 SOFTWARE TESTING STRATEGIES 473\\nuote:\\n“We found to our\\nsurprise that it\\nwasn’t as easy to\\nget programs right\\nas we had thought.\\nI can remember\\nthe exact instant\\nwhen I realized\\nthat a large part of\\nmy life from then\\non was going to be\\nspent in finding\\nmistakes in my\\nown programs.”\\nMaurice Wilkes,\\ndiscovers\\ndebugging, 1949\\n5 In making the statement, we take the broadest possible view of testing.

The objective is realized\\nby a combination of systematic evaluation, intuition, and luck. Bradley [Bra85]\\ndescribes the debugging approach in this way:\\nDebugging is a straightforward application of the scientific method that has been devel-\\noped over 2,500 years. The basis of debugging is to locate the problem’s source [the\\ncause] by binary partitioning, through working hypotheses that predict new values to be\\nexamined.\\nTake a simple non-software example: A lamp in my house does not work.

I plug the suspect lamp into a working\\nsocket and a working appliance into the suspect circuit. So goes the alternation of\\nhypothesis and test.\\nIn general, three debugging strategies have been proposed [Mye79]: (1) brute\\nforce, (2) backtracking, and (3) cause elimination. Each of these strategies can\\nbe conducted manually, but modern debugging tools can make the process much\\nmore effective.\\nDebugging tactics. The brute force category of debugging is probably the most\\ncommon and least efficient method for isolating the cause of a software error. You\\napply brute force debugging methods when all else fails. Using a “let the computer\\nfind the error” philosophy, memory dumps are taken, run-time traces are invoked,\\nand the program is loaded with output statements. You hope that somewhere in the\\nmorass of information that is produced you’ll find a clue that can lead to the cause\\nof an error. Although the mass of information produced may ultimately lead to\\nsuccess, it more frequently leads to wasted effort and time. Thought must be\\nexpended first!\\nBacktracking is a fairly common debugging approach that can be used success-\\nfully in small programs. Beginning at the site where a symptom has been uncovered,\\nthe source code is traced backward (manually) until the cause is found. Unfortu-\\nnately, as the number of source lines increases, the number of potential backward\\npaths may become unmanageably large.\\nThe third approach to debugging—cause elimination—is manifested by induction\\nor deduction and introduces the concept of binary partitioning. Data related to the\\nerror occurrence are organized to isolate potential causes. A “cause hypothesis” is\\ndevised and the aforementioned data are used to prove or disprove the hypothesis.\\nAlternatively, a list of all possible causes is developed and tests are conducted to\\neliminate each. If initial tests indicate that a particular cause hypothesis shows\\npromise, data are refined in an attempt to isolate the bug.\\nAutomated debugging. Each of these debugging approaches can be supple-\\nmented with debugging tools that can provide you with semiautomated support as\\ndebugging strategies are attempted. Hailpern and Santhanam [Hai02] summarize\\nthe state of these tools when they note, “. . . many new approaches have been pro-\\nposed and many commercial debugging environments are available. Integrated\\ndevelopment environments (IDEs) provide a way to capture some of the language-\\nspecific predetermined errors (e.g., missing end-of-statement characters, unde-\\nfined variables, and so on) without requiring compilation.” A wide variety of\\ndebugging compilers, dynamic debugging aids (“tracers”), automatic test-case\\ngenerators, and cross-reference mapping tools are available. However, tools are\\nnot a substitute for careful evaluation based on a complete design model and clear\\nsource code.\\n476 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nuote:\\n“The first step in\\nfixing a broken\\nprogram is getting\\nit to fail repeatably\\n(on the simplest\\nexample possible).”\\nT.

But, as we have already noted, the\\ncorrection of a bug can introduce other errors and therefore do more harm than\\ngood. Van Vleck [Van89] suggests three simple questions that you should ask before\\nmaking the “correction” that removes the cause of a bug:\\n1. Is the cause of the bug reproduced in another part of the program? In many situ-\\nations, a program defect is caused by an erroneous pattern of logic that may\\nbe reproduced elsewhere. Explicit consideration of the logical pattern may\\nresult in the discovery of other errors.\\n2. What “next bug” might be introduced by the fix I’m about to make?Before the\\ncorrection is made, the source code (or, better, the design) should be evalu-\\nated to assess coupling of logic and data structures. If the correction is to be\\nmade in a highly coupled section of the program, special care must be taken\\nwhen any change is made.\\nCHAPTER 17 SOFTWARE TESTING STRATEGIES 477\\nDebugging\\nObjective: These tools provide automated\\nassistance for those who must debug software\\nproblems.

Regardless of the type of software you build, a strategy for systematic\\ntest planning, execution, and control begins by considering small elements of the\\nsoftware and moves outward toward the program as a whole.\\nThe objective of software testing is to uncover errors. For conventional software,\\nthis objective is achieved through a series of test steps. Unit and integration tests\\nconcentrate on functional verification of a component and incorporation of compo-\\nnents into the software architecture. Validation testing demonstrates traceability to\\nsoftware requirements, and system testing validates software once it has been\\nincorporated into a larger system. Each test step is accomplished through a series of\\nsystematic test techniques that assist in the design of test cases. With each testing\\nstep, the level of abstraction with which software is considered is broadened.\\nThe strategy for testing object-oriented software begins with tests that exercise\\nthe operations within a class and then moves to thread-based testing for integration.\\nThreads are sets of classes that respond to an input or event.

Therefore, you should design and implement a computer-\\nbased system or a product with “testability” in mind. At the same time, the tests\\nthemselves must exhibit a set of characteristics that achieve the goal of finding the\\nmost errors with a minimum of effort.\\nTestability. James Bach\\n1 provides the following definition for testability: “Software\\ntestability is simply how easily [a computer program] can be tested.” The following\\ncharacteristics lead to testable software.\\nOperability. “The better it works, the more efficiently it can be tested.” If a system\\nis designed and implemented with quality in mind, relatively few bugs will block\\nthe execution of tests, allowing testing to progress without fits and starts.\\nObservability. “What you see is what you test.” Inputs provided as part of testing\\nproduce distinct outputs. System states and variables are visible or queriable dur-\\ning execution. Incorrect output is easily identified. Internal errors are automatically\\ndetected and reported. Source code is accessible.\\nControllability. “The better we can control the software, the more the testing can\\nbe automated and optimized.” All possible outputs can be generated through some\\ncombination of input, and I/O formats are consistent and structured. All code is\\nexecutable through some combination of input. Software and hardware states and\\nuote:\\n“Every program\\ndoes something\\nright, it just may\\nnot be the thing we\\nwant it to do.”\\nAuthor unknown\\nWhat are the\\ncharacter-\\nistics of\\ntestability?\\n?\\n1 The paragraphs that follow are used with permission of James Bach (copyright 1994) and have been\\nadapted from material that originally appeared in a posting in the newsgroup comp.software-eng.\\nWhat are the steps? For conventional applica-\\ntions, software is tested from two different per-\\nspectives: (1) internal program logic is exercised\\nusing “white box” test-case design techniques\\nand (2) software requirements are exercised\\nusing “black box” test-case design techniques.\\nUse cases assist in the design of tests to uncover\\nerrors at the software validation level. In every\\ncase, the intent is to find the maximum number\\nof errors with the minimum amount of effort\\nand time.\\nWhat is the work product? A set of test cases\\ndesigned to exercise both internal logic,\\ninterfaces, component collaborations, and\\nexternal requirements is designed and docu-\\nmented, expected results are defined, and actual\\nresults are recorded.\\nHow do I ensure that I’ve done it right? When\\nyou begin testing, change your point of view. Try\\nhard to “break” the software! Design test cases\\nin a disciplined fashion and review the test cases\\nyou do create for thoroughness.

The software recovers well from failures.\\nUnderstandability. “The more information we have, the smarter we will test.” The\\narchitectural design and the dependencies between internal, external, and shared\\ncomponents are well understood. Technical documentation is instantly accessible,\\nwell organized, specific and detailed, and accurate. Changes to the design are\\ncommunicated to testers.\\nYou can use the attributes suggested by Bach to develop a software configuration\\n(i.e., programs, data, and documents) that is amenable to testing.\\nTest Characteristics. And what about the tests themselves? Kaner, Falk, and\\nNguyen [Kan93] suggest the following attributes of a “good” test:\\nA good test has a high probability of finding an error. To achieve this goal, the\\ntester must understand the software and attempt to develop a mental picture of\\nhow the software might fail. Ideally, the classes of failure are probed. For example,\\none class of potential failure in a graphical user interface is the failure to recognize\\nproper mouse position. A set of tests would be designed to exercise the mouse in\\nan attempt to demonstrate an error in mouse position recognition.\\nA good test is not redundant. Testing time and resources are limited. There is no\\npoint in conducting a test that has the same purpose as another test. Every test\\nshould have a different purpose (even if it is subtly different).\\nA good test should be “best of breed”[Kan93]. In a group of tests that have a simi-\\nlar intent, time and resource limitations may mitigate toward the execution of only\\na subset of these tests. In such cases, the test that has the highest likelihood of\\nuncovering a whole class of errors should be used.\\nA good test should be neither too simple nor too complex.Although it is sometimes\\npossible to combine a series of tests into one test case, the possible side effects\\nassociated with this approach may mask errors. In general, each test should be\\nexecuted separately.\\nCHAPTER 18 TESTING CONVENTIONAL APPLICATIONS 483\\nuote:\\n“Errors are more\\ncommon, more\\npervasive, and\\nmore troublesome\\nin software than\\nwith other\\ntechnologies.”\\nDavid Parnas\\nWhat is a\\n“good”\\ntest?\\n?\\npre75977_ch18.qxd  11/27/08  6:12 PM  Page 483'),\n",

(2) Knowing the internal workings of a prod-\\nuct, tests can be conducted to ensure that “all gears mesh,” that is, internal operations\\nare performed according to specifications and all internal components have been ade-\\nquately exercised. The first test approach takes an external view and is called black-box\\ntesting. The second requires an internal view and is termed white-box testing.\\n2\\nBlack-box testing alludes to tests that are conducted at the software interface.\\nA black-box test examines some fundamental aspect of a system with little regard\\nfor the internal logical structure of the software. White-box testingof software is pred-\\nicated on close examination of procedural detail.

This would, undeniably, cause havoc\\nin most development schedules.\\nTherefore, it is reasonable to assert that exhaustive\\ntesting is impossible for large software systems.\\nINFO\\n18.3 W HITE -B OX TESTING\\nWhite-box testing, sometimes called glass-box testing, is a test-case design philoso-\\nphy that uses the control structure described as part of component-level design to\\nderive test cases. Using white-box testing methods, you can derive test cases that\\n(1) guarantee that all independent paths within a module have been exercised at\\nleast once, (2) exercise all logical decisions on their true and false sides, (3) execute\\nall loops at their boundaries and within their operational bounds, and (4) exercise\\ninternal data structures to ensure their validity.\\n18.4 B ASIS PATH TESTING\\nBasis path testing is a white-box testing technique first proposed by Tom McCabe\\n[McC76]. The basis path method enables the test-case designer to derive a logical\\ncomplexity measure of a procedural design and use this measure as a guide for defin-\\ning a basis set of execution paths. Test cases derived to exercise the basis set are guar-\\nanteed to execute every statement in the program at least one time during testing.\\n18.4.1 Flow Graph Notation\\nBefore we consider the basis path method, a simple notation for the representation\\nof control flow, called a flow graph (or program graph) must be introduced.\\n3 The flow\\ngraph depicts logical control flow using the notation illustrated in Figure 18.1. Each\\nstructured construct (Chapter 10) has a corresponding flow graph symbol.\\nuote:\\n“Bugs lurk in\\ncorners and\\ncongregate at\\nboundaries.”\\nBoris Beizer\\n3 In actuality, the basis path method can be conducted without the use of flow graphs. However, they\\nserve as a useful notation for understanding control flow and illustrating the approach.\\npre75977_ch18.qxd  11/27/08  6:12 PM  Page 485'),\n",

A data structure, called a graph matrix, can be quite\\nuseful for developing a software tool that assists in basis path testing.\\nA graph matrix is a square matrix whose size (i.e., number of rows and columns)\\nis equal to the number of nodes on the flow graph. Each row and column corre-\\nsponds to an identified node, and matrix entries correspond to connections (an edge)\\nbetween nodes. A simple example of a flow graph and its corresponding graph\\nmatrix [Bei90] is shown in Figure 18.6.\\nCHAPTER 18 TESTING CONVENTIONAL APPLICATIONS 491\\n1\\n3\\n4\\n2\\n5\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\ne\\nf\\ng\\nFlow graph\\n13 4 25\\n1\\n3\\n4\\n2\\n5\\na\\ne g\\ncf\\ndb\\nConnected to\\nnode\\nNode\\nGraph matrix\\nFIGURE 18.6\\nGraph matrix\\npre75977_ch18.qxd  11/27/08  6:12 PM  Page 491'),\n",

However, by adding a link weight to each matrix entry, the graph matrix\\ncan become a powerful tool for evaluating program control structure during testing.\\nThe link weight provides additional information about control flow. In its simplest\\nform, the link weight is 1 (a connection exists) or 0 (a connection does not exist). But\\nlink weights can be assigned other, more interesting properties:\\n• The probability that a link (edge) will be execute.\\n• The processing time expended during traversal of a link\\n• The memory required during traversal of a link\\n• The resources required during traversal of a link.\\nBeizer [Bei90] provides a thorough treatment of additional mathematical algo-\\nrithms that can be applied to graph matrices. Using these techniques, the analysis\\nrequired to design test cases can be partially or fully automated.\\n18.5 C ONTROL STRUCTURE TESTING\\nThe basis path testing technique described in Section 18.4 is one of a number of tech-\\nniques for control structure testing. Although basis path testing is simple and highly\\neffective, it is not sufficient in itself. In this section, other variations on control struc-\\nture testing are discussed. These broaden testing coverage and improve the quality\\nof white-box testing.\\n18.5.1 Condition Testing\\nCondition testing [Tai89] is a test-case design method that exercises the logical con-\\nditions contained in a program module. A simple condition is a Boolean variable or\\na relational expression, possibly preceded with one NOT (¬) operator. A relational\\nexpression takes the form\\nE\\n1 <relational-operator> E2\\nwhere E1 and E2 are arithmetic expressions and <relational-operator> is one of the\\nfollowing: /H11021,/H11349,/H11005,/HS33527(nonequality), /H11022, or/H11350. A compound conditionis composed of\\ntwo or more simple conditions, Boolean operators, and parentheses. We assume\\nthat Boolean operators allowed in a compound condition include OR ( /H20841), AND (&),\\nand NOT (¬). A condition without relational expressions is referred to as a Boolean\\nexpression.\\nIf a condition is incorrect, then at least one component of the condition is incor-\\nrect. Therefore, types of errors in a condition include Boolean operator errors\\n492 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nWhat is a\\ngraph matrix\\nand how do I\\nextend it for use\\nin testing?\\n?\\nuote:\\n“Paying more\\nattention to\\nrunning tests than\\nto designing them\\nis a classic\\nmistake.”\\nBrian Marick\\nErrors are much more\\ncommon in the\\nneighborhood of\\nlogical conditions than\\nthey are in the locus of\\nsequential processing\\nstatements.\\npre75977_ch18.qxd  11/27/08  6:12 PM  Page 492'),\n",

The\\ncondition testing method focuses on testing each condition in the program to ensure\\nthat it does not contain errors.\\n18.5.2 Data Flow Testing\\nThe data flow testing method [Fra93] selects test paths of a program according to the\\nlocations of definitions and uses of variables in the program. To illustrate the data\\nflow testing approach, assume that each statement in a program is assigned a unique\\nstatement number and that each function does not modify its parameters or global\\nvariables. For a statement with S as its statement number,\\nDEF(S) /H11005{X | statement S contains a definition of X}\\nUSE(S) /H11005{X | statement S contains a use of X}\\nIf statement S is an if or loop statement, its DEF set is empty and its USE set is based\\non the condition of statement S. The definition of variable X at statement S is said to\\nbe live at statement S’if there exists a path from statement Sto statement S’that con-\\ntains no other definition of X.\\nA definition-use (DU) chain of variable X is of the form [X, S, S’], where Sand S’are\\nstatement numbers, X is in DEF(S) and USE(S’), and the definition of X in statement\\nS is live at statement S’.\\nOne simple data flow testing strategy is to require that every DU chain be covered\\nat least once. We refer to this strategy as the DU testing strategy. It has been shown\\nthat DU testing does not guarantee the coverage of all branches of a program. How-\\never, a branch is not guaranteed to be covered by DU testing only in rare situations\\nsuch as if-then-else constructs in which the then part has no definition of any vari-\\nable and the else part does not exist. In this situation, the else branch of the if state-\\nment is not necessarily covered by DU testing.\\n18.5.3 Loop Testing\\nLoops are the cornerstone for the vast majority of all algorithms implemented in\\nsoftware. And yet, we often pay them little heed while conducting software tests.\\nLoop testing is a white-box testing technique that focuses exclusively on the\\nvalidity of loop constructs. Four different classes of loops [Bei90] can be defined: sim-\\nple loops, concatenated loops, nested loops, and unstructured loops (Figure 18.7).\\nSimple loops. The following set of tests can be applied to simple loops, where n\\nis the maximum number of allowable passes through the loop.\\n1. Skip the loop entirely.\\n2. Only one pass through the loop.\\n3. Two passes through the loop.\\nCHAPTER 18 TESTING CONVENTIONAL APPLICATIONS 493\\nIt is unrealistic to\\nassume that data flow\\ntesting will be used\\nextensively when\\ntesting a large system.\\nHowever, it can be\\nused in a targeted\\nfashion for areas of\\nsoftware that are\\nsuspect.\\nuote:\\n“Good testers are\\nmasters at noticing\\n‘something funny’\\nand acting on it.”\\nBrian Marick\\npre75977_ch18.qxd  11/27/08  6:12 PM  Page 493'),\n",

If we were to extend the test approach for simple loops to nested\\nloops, the number of possible tests would grow geometrically as the level of nesting\\nincreases. This would result in an impractical number of tests. Beizer [Bei90] sug-\\ngests an approach that will help to reduce the number of tests:\\n1. Start at the innermost loop. Set all other loops to minimum values.\\n2. Conduct simple loop tests for the innermost loop while holding the outer\\nloops at their minimum iteration parameter (e.g., loop counter) values.

Rather, it is a com-\\nplementary approach that is likely to uncover a different class of errors than white-\\nbox methods.\\nBlack-box testing attempts to find errors in the following categories: (1) incorrect\\nor missing functions, (2) interface errors, (3) errors in data structures or external\\ndatabase access, (4) behavior or performance errors, and (5) initialization and\\ntermination errors.\\nUnlike white-box testing, which is performed early in the testing process, black-\\nbox testing tends to be applied during later stages of testing (see Chapter 17). Because\\nblack-box testing purposely disregards control structure, attention is focused on the\\ninformation domain. Tests are designed to answer the following questions:\\n• How is functional validity tested?\\n• How are system behavior and performance tested?\\n• What classes of input will make good test cases?\\n• Is the system particularly sensitive to certain input values?\\n• How are the boundaries of a data class isolated?\\n• What data rates and data volume can the system tolerate?\\n• What effect will specific combinations of data have on system operation?\\nBy applying black-box techniques, you derive a set of test cases that satisfy the fol-\\nlowing criteria [Mye79]: (1) test cases that reduce, by a count that is greater than one,\\nthe number of additional test cases that must be designed to achieve reasonable\\ntesting, and (2) test cases that tell you something about the presence or absence of\\nclasses of errors, rather than an error associated only with the specific test at hand.\\n18.6.1 Graph-Based Testing Methods\\nThe first step in black-box testing is to understand the objects 5 that are modeled in\\nsoftware and the relationships that connect these objects.

The\\nstate diagram (Chapter 7) can be used to assist in creating graphs of this type.\\nData flow modeling. The nodes are data objects, and the links are the\\ntransformations that occur to translate one data object into another. For\\nexample, the node FICA tax withheld (FTW) is computed from gross wages\\n(GW) using the relationship, FTW /H115490.62 /H11547GW.\\nTiming modeling. The nodes are program objects, and the links are the\\nsequential connections between those objects. Link weights are used to\\nspecify the required execution times as the program executes.\\nA detailed discussion of each of these graph-based testing methods is beyond\\nthe scope of this book.

An ideal test\\ncase single-handedly uncovers a class of errors (e.g., incorrect processing of all\\ncharacter data) that might otherwise require many test cases to be executed before\\nthe general error is observed.\\nTest-case design for equivalence partitioning is based on an evaluation of\\nequivalence classes for an input condition.

Equivalence classes may be defined according to the\\nfollowing guidelines:\\n1. If an input condition specifies a range, one valid and two invalid equivalence\\nclasses are defined.\\n2. If an input condition requires a specific value, one valid and two invalid\\nequivalence classes are defined.\\n3.

Test cases should be designed to create an output report that\\nproduces the maximum (and minimum) allowable number of table entries.\\n4.

That is,\\nthe number of input parameters is small and the values that each of the parameters\\nmay take are clearly bounded. When these numbers are very small (e.g., three input\\nparameters taking on three discrete values each), it is possible to consider every\\ninput permutation and exhaustively test the input domain. However, as the number\\nof input values grows and the number of discrete values for each data item increases,\\nexhaustive testing becomes impractical or impossible.\\nOrthogonal array testing can be applied to problems in which the input domain is\\nrelatively small but too large to accommodate exhaustive testing. The orthogonal\\narray testing method is particularly useful in finding region faults—an error category\\nassociated with faulty logic within a software component.\\nTo illustrate the difference between orthogonal array testing and more conven-\\ntional “one input item at a time” approaches, consider a system that has three input\\nitems, X, Y,and Z. Each of these input items has three discrete values associated with\\nit. There are 3\\n3 /H1100527 possible test cases. Phadke [Pha97] suggests a geometric view\\nof the possible test cases associated with X, Y, and Z illustrated in Figure 18.9.\\nReferring to the figure, one input item at a time may be varied in sequence along each\\ninput axis. This results in relatively limited coverage of the input domain (repre-\\nsented by the left-hand cube in the figure).\\nWhen orthogonal array testing occurs, an L9 orthogonal array of test cases is\\ncreated. The L9 orthogonal array has a “balancing property” [Pha97]. That is, test\\ncases (represented by dark dots in the figure) are “dispersed uniformly throughout\\nthe test domain,” as illustrated in the right-hand cube in Figure 18.9.

Analyze an existing behavioral model for the software or create one.\\nRecall that a behavioral model indicates how software will respond to exter-\\nnal events or stimuli. To create the model, you should perform the steps\\ndiscussed in Chapter 7: (1) evaluate all use cases to fully understand the\\nsequence of interaction within the system, (2) identify events that drive the\\ninteraction sequence and understand how these events relate to specific\\nobjects, (3) create a sequence for each use case, (4) build a UML state\\ndiagram for the system (e.g., see Figure 7.6), and (5) review the behavioral\\nmodel to verify accuracy and consistency.\\n2. Traverse the behavioral model and specify the inputs that will force\\nthe software to make the transition from state to state. The inputs will\\ntrigger events that will cause the transition to occur.\\n3. Review the behavioral model and note the expected outputs as the\\nsoftware makes the transition from state to state. Recall that each\\nstate transition is triggered by an event and that as a consequence of the\\ntransition, some function is invoked and outputs are created. For each set of\\ninputs (test cases) you specified in step 2, specify the expected outputs as\\nthey are characterized in the behavioral model. “A fundamental assumption\\nof this testing is that there is some mechanism, a test oracle, that will deter-\\nmine whether or not the results of a test execution are correct” [DAC03].

In most cases, the oracle is the requirements model,\\nbut it could also be another document or application, data recorded else-\\nwhere, or even a human expert.\\n4. Execute the test cases.

Recalling the defi-\\nnition of software presented in Chapter 1, it is important to note that testing must\\nalso extend to the third element of the software configuration—documentation.\\nErrors in documentation can be as devastating to the acceptance of the program\\nas errors in data or source code. Nothing is more frustrating than following a user\\nguide or an online help facility exactly and getting results or behaviors that do not\\ncoincide with those predicted by the documentation. It is for this reason that that\\ndocumentation testing should be a meaningful part of every software test plan.\\nDocumentation testing can be approached in two phases. The first phase, techni-\\ncal review (Chapter 15), examines the document for editorial clarity. The second\\nphase, live test, uses the documentation in conjunction with the actual program.\\nSurprisingly, a live test for documentation can be approached using techniques\\nthat are analogous to many of the black-box testing methods discussed earlier.\\nGraph-based testing can be used to describe the use of the program; equivalence\\npartitioning and boundary value analysis can be used to define various classes of\\ninput and associated interactions. MBT can be used to ensure that documented\\nbehavior and actual behavior coincide. Program usage is then tracked through the\\ndocumentation.\\nCHAPTER 18 TESTING CONVENTIONAL APPLICATIONS 505\\nDocumentation Testing\\nThe following questions should be answered\\nduring documentation and/or help facility\\ntesting:\\n• Does the documentation accurately describe how to\\naccomplish each mode of use?\\n• Is the description of each interaction sequence\\naccurate?\\n• Are examples accurate?\\n• Are terminology, menu descriptions, and system\\nresponses consistent with the actual program?\\n• Is it relatively easy to locate guidance within the\\ndocumentation?\\n• Can troubleshooting be accomplished easily with the\\ndocumentation?\\n• Are the document’s table of contents and index robust,\\naccurate, and complete?\\n• Is the design of the document (layout, typefaces,\\nindentation, graphics) conducive to understanding and\\nquick assimilation of information?\\n• Are all software error messages displayed for the user\\ndescribed in more detail in the document? Are actions\\nto be taken as a consequence of an error message\\nclearly delineated?\\n• If hypertext links are used, are they accurate and\\ncomplete?\\n• If hypertext is used, is the navigation design\\nappropriate for the information required?\\nThe only viable way to answer these questions is to\\nhave an independent third party (e.g., selected users) test\\nthe documentation in the context of program usage.

Not only does the test-\\ncase designer have to consider conventional test cases but also event handling (i.e.,\\ninterrupt processing), the timing of the data, and the parallelism of the tasks\\n(processes) that handle the data. In many situations, test data provided when a real-\\ntime system is in one state will result in proper processing, while the same data pro-\\nvided when the system is in a different state may lead to error.\\nFor example, the real-time software that controls a new photocopier accepts\\noperator interrupts (i.e., the machine operator hits control keys such as RESET or\\nDARKEN) with no error when the machine is making copies (in the “copying” state).\\nThese same operator interrupts, if input when the machine is in the “jammed” state,\\ncause a display of the diagnostic code indicating the location of the jam to be lost\\n(an error).\\nIn addition, the intimate relationship that exists between real-time software and\\nits hardware environment can also cause testing problems. Software tests must\\nconsider the impact of hardware faults on software processing. Such faults can be\\nextremely difficult to simulate realistically.\\nComprehensive test-case design methods for real-time systems continue to\\nevolve. However, an overall four-step strategy can be proposed:\\n• Task testing. The first step in the testing of real-time software is to test\\neach task independently. That is, conventional tests are designed for each\\ntask and executed independently during these tests. Task testing uncovers\\nerrors in logic and function but not timing or behavior.\\n• Behavioral testing. Using system models created with automated tools, it\\nis possible to simulate the behavior of a real-time system and examine its\\nbehavior as a consequence of external events. These analysis activities can\\nserve as the basis for the design of test cases that are conducted when the\\nreal-time software has been built. Using a technique that is similar to equiva-\\nlence partitioning (Section 18.6.2), events (e.g., interrupts, control signals)\\nare categorized for testing. For example, events for the photocopier might\\nbe user interrupts (e.g., reset counter), mechanical interrupts (e.g., paper\\njammed), system interrupts (e.g., toner low), and failure modes (e.g., roller\\noverheated). Each of these events is tested individually, and the behavior of\\nthe executable system is examined to detect errors that occur as a conse-\\nquence of processing associated with these events. The behavior of the\\nsystem model (developed during the analysis activity) and the executable\\nsoftware can be compared for conformance. Once each class of events has\\nbeen tested, events are presented to the system in random order and with\\nrandom frequency. The behavior of the software is examined to detect\\nbehavior errors.\\n506 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nWhat is an\\neffective\\nstrategy for\\ntesting a real-time\\nsystem?\\n?\\npre75977_ch18.qxd  11/27/08  6:12 PM  Page 506'),\n",

Once errors in individual tasks and in system behavior\\nhave been isolated, testing shifts to time-related errors. Asynchronous tasks\\nthat are known to communicate with one another are tested with different\\ndata rates and processing load to determine if intertask synchronization errors\\nwill occur. In addition, tasks that communicate via a message queue or data\\nstore are tested to uncover errors in the sizing of these data storage areas.\\n• System testing. Software and hardware are integrated, and a full range of\\nsystem tests are conducted in an attempt to uncover errors at the software-\\nhardware interface. Most real-time systems process interrupts. Therefore,\\ntesting the handling of these Boolean events is essential. Using the state\\ndiagram (Chapter 7), the tester develops a list of all possible interrupts and\\nthe processing that occurs as a consequence of the interrupts. Tests are then\\ndesigned to assess the following system characteristics:\\n• Are interrupt priorities properly assigned and properly handled?\\n• Is processing for each interrupt handled correctly?\\n• Does the performance (e.g., processing time) of each interrupt-handling\\nprocedure conform to requirements?\\n• Does a high volume of interrupts arriving at critical times create problems\\nin function or performance?\\nIn addition, global data areas that are used to transfer information as part of\\ninterrupt processing should be tested to assess the potential for the generation of\\nside effects.\\n18.9 P ATTERNS FOR SOFTWARE TESTING\\nThe use of patterns as a mechanism for describing solutions to specific design problems\\nwas discussed in Chapter 12. But patterns can also be used to propose solutions to other\\nsoftware engineering situations—in this case, software testing.Testing patternsdescribe\\ncommon testing problems and solutions that can assist you in dealing with them.\\nNot only do testing patterns provide you with useful guidance as testing activities\\ncommence, they also provide three additional benefits described by Marick [Mar02]:\\n1. They [patterns] provide a vocabulary for problem-solvers. “Hey, you know, we should\\nuse a Null Object.”\\n2. They focus attention on the forces behind a problem. That allows [test case] designers\\nto better understand when and why a solution applies.\\n3. They encourage iterative thinking. Each solution creates a new context in which new\\nproblems can be solved.\\nAlthough these benefits are “soft,” they should not be overlooked. Much of\\nsoftware testing, even during the past decade, has been an ad hoc activity.

Dozens of testing patterns have been proposed in the literature (e.g.,\\n[Mar02]). The following three testing patterns (presented in abstract form only)\\nprovide representative examples:\\nPattern name: PairTesting\\nAbstract: A process-oriented pattern, PairTesting describes a technique that is anal-\\nogous to pair programming (Chapter 3) in which two testers work together to design and\\nexecute a series of tests that can be applied to unit, integration or validation testing\\nactivities.\\nPattern name: SeparateTestInterface\\nAbstract: There is a need to test every class in an object-oriented system, including\\n“internal classes” (i.e., classes that do not expose any interface outside of the component\\nthat used them). The SeparateTestInterface pattern describes how to create “a test\\ninterface that can be used to describe specific tests on classes that are visible only inter-\\nnally to a component” [Lan01].\\nPattern name: ScenarioTesting\\nAbstract: Once unit and integration tests have been conducted, there is a need to\\ndetermine whether the software will perform in a manner that satisfies users. The\\nScenarioTesting pattern describes a technique for exercising the software from the\\nuser’s point of view. A failure at this level indicates that the software has failed to meet a\\nuser visible requirement [Kan01].\\nA comprehensive discussion of testing patterns is beyond the scope of this book.\\nIf you have further interest, see [Bin99] and [Mar02] for additional information on\\nthis important topic.\\n18.10 S UMMARY\\nThe primary objective for test-case design is to derive a set of tests that have the\\nhighest likelihood for uncovering errors in software. To accomplish this objective,\\ntwo different categories of test-case design techniques are used: white-box testing\\nand black-box testing.\\nWhite-box tests focus on the program control structure. Test cases are derived to\\nensure that all statements in the program have been executed at least once during\\ntesting and that all logical conditions have been exercised. Basis path testing, a\\nwhite-box technique, makes use of program graphs (or graph matrices) to derive\\nthe set of linearly independent tests that will ensure statement coverage.

Black-box testing techniques focus on the\\ninformation domain of the software, deriving test cases by partitioning the input and\\noutput domain of a program in a manner that provides thorough test coverage.\\nEquivalence partitioning divides the input domain into classes of data that are likely\\nto exercise a specific software function. Boundary value analysis probes the pro-\\ngram’s ability to handle data at the limits of acceptability.

Object-oriented testing is performed\\nby software engineers and testing specialists.\\nWhy is it important? You have to execute the\\nprogram before it gets to the customer with the\\nspecific intent of removing all errors, so that\\nthe customer will not experience the frustration\\nassociated with a poor-quality product.

At each stage, the models can be “tested” in\\nan attempt to uncover errors prior to their propagation to the next iteration.\\nIt can be argued that the review of OO analysis and design models is especially\\nuseful because the same semantic constructs (e.g., classes, attributes, operations,\\nmessages) appear at the analysis, design, and code levels. Therefore, a problem in\\nthe definition of class attributes that is uncovered during analysis will circumvent\\nside effects that might occur if the problem were not discovered until design or code\\n(or even the next iteration of analysis).\\nFor example, consider a class in which a number of attributes are defined during\\nthe first iteration of analysis. An extraneous attribute is appended to the class (due\\nto a misunderstanding of the problem domain). Two operations are then specified to\\nmanipulate the attribute. A review is conducted and a domain expert points out the\\nproblem. By eliminating the extraneous attribute at this stage, the following prob-\\nlems and unnecessary effort may be avoided during analysis:\\n1. Special subclasses may have been generated to accommodate the unneces-\\nsary attribute or exceptions to it. Work involved in the creation of unneces-\\nsary subclasses has been avoided.\\n2. A misinterpretation of the class definition may lead to incorrect or extrane-\\nous class relationships.\\n3. The behavior of the system or its classes may be improperly characterized to\\naccommodate the extraneous attribute.\\nIf the problem is not uncovered during analysis and propagated further, the\\nfollowing problems could occur (and will have been avoided because of the earlier\\nreview) during design:\\n1.

An inconsistent analysis or design model has\\nrepresentations in one part that are not correctly reflected in other portions of the\\nmodel” [McG94].\\nTo assess consistency, you should examine each class and its connections to\\nother classes. The class-responsibility-collaboration (CRC) model or an object-\\nrelationship diagram can be used to facilitate this activity. As you learned in Chap-\\nter 6, the CRC model is composed of CRC index cards. Each CRC card lists the class\\nname, its responsibilities (operations), and its collaborators (other classes to which\\nit sends messages and on which it depends for the accomplishment of its responsi-\\nbilities). The collaborations imply a series of relationships (i.e., connections)\\nbetween classes of the OO system. The object relationship model provides a graphic\\nrepresentation of the connections between classes. All of this information can be\\nobtained from the analysis model (Chapters 6 and 7).\\nTo evaluate the class model the following steps have been recommended [McG94]:\\n1. Revisit the CRC model and the object-relationship model. Cross-check\\nto ensure that all collaborations implied by the requirements model are prop-\\nerly reflected in the both.\\n2.

In conventional\\napplications, unit testing focuses on the smallest compilable program unit—the sub-\\nprogram (e.g., component, module, subroutine, procedure). Once each of these units\\nhas been testing individually, it is integrated into a program structure while a series\\nof regression tests are run to uncover errors due to interfacing the modules and side\\neffects that are caused by the addition of new units. Finally, the system as a whole is\\ntested to ensure that errors in requirements are uncovered.\\n19.3.1 Unit Testing in the OO Context\\nWhen object-oriented software is considered, the concept of the unit changes.\\nEncapsulation drives the definition of classes and objects. This means that each class\\nand each instance of a class (object) packages attributes (data) and the operations\\n(also known as methods or services) that manipulate these data. Rather than testing\\nan individual module, the smallest testable unit is the encapsulated class. Because a\\nclass can contain a number of different operations and a particular operation may\\nexist as part of a number of different classes, the meaning of unit testing changes\\ndramatically.\\nWe can no longer test a single operation in isolation (the conventional view of unit\\ntesting) but rather, as part of a class. To illustrate, consider a class hierarchy in which\\nan operation X() is defined for the superclass and is inherited by a number of sub-\\nclasses. Each subclass uses operation X(), but it is applied within the context of the\\nprivate attributes and operations that have been defined for each subclass. Because\\nthe context in which operation X()is used varies in subtle ways, it is necessary to test\\noperation X() in the context of each of the subclasses. This means that testing oper-\\nation X() in a vacuum (the traditional unit-testing approach) is ineffective in the\\nobject-oriented context.\\nClass testing for OO software is the equivalent of unit testing for conventional\\nsoftware.\\n3 Unlike unit testing of conventional software, which tends to focus on the\\nalgorithmic detail of a module and the data that flows across the module interface,\\nclass testing for OO software is driven by the operations encapsulated by the class\\nand the state behavior of the class.\\n19.3.2 Integration Testing in the OO Context\\nBecause object-oriented software does not have a hierarchical control structure,\\nconventional top-down and bottom-up integration strategies have little meaning.\\n516 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nThe smallest testable\\n“unit” in OO software\\nis the class.

Each thread is integrated and tested individually. Re-\\ngression testing is applied to ensure that no side effects occur. The second integra-\\ntion approach, use-based testing, begins the construction of the system by testing\\nthose classes (called independent classes) that use very few (if any) of server classes.\\nAfter the independent classes are tested, the next layer of classes, called dependent\\nclasses, that use the independent classes are tested. This sequence of testing layers\\nof dependent classes continues until the entire system is constructed.

Like\\nconventional validation, the validation of OO software focuses on user-visible\\nactions and user-recognizable outputs from the system. To assist in the derivation of\\nvalidation tests, the tester should draw upon use cases (Chapters 5 and 6) that are\\npart of the requirements model. The use case provides a scenario that has a high like-\\nlihood of uncovered errors in user-interaction requirements.\\nConventional black-box testing methods (Chapter 18) can be used to drive vali-\\ndation tests.

Because attributes and operations are encapsulated, testing\\noperations outside of the class is generally unproductive. Although encapsulation is\\nan essential design concept for OO, it can create a minor obstacle when testing. As\\nBinder [Bin94a] notes, “Testing requires reporting on the concrete and abstract state\\nof an object.” Yet, encapsulation can make this information somewhat difficult to\\nobtain. Unless built-in operations are provided to report the values for class attrib-\\nutes, a snapshot of the state of an object may be difficult to acquire.\\nInheritance may also present you with additional challenges during test-case\\ndesign. I have already noted that each new usage context requires retesting, even\\nthough reuse has been achieved. In addition, multiple inheritance\\n4 complicates test-\\ning further by increasing the number of contexts for which testing is required\\n[Bin94a]. If subclasses instantiated from a superclass are used within the same prob-\\nlem domain, it is likely that the set of test cases derived for the superclass can be used\\nwhen testing the subclass. However, if the subclass is used in an entirely different\\ncontext, the superclass test cases will have little applicability and a new set of tests\\nmust be designed.\\n19.4.2 Applicability of Conventional Test-Case Design Methods\\nThe white-box testing methods described in Chapter 18 can be applied to the opera-\\ntions defined for a class.

Because the product or system must\\nconform to customer requirements, preliminary planning required to perform fault-\\nbased testing begins with the analysis model. The tester looks for plausible faults (i.e.,\\naspects of the implementation of the system that may result in defects). To determine\\nwhether these faults exist, test cases are designed to exercise the design or code.\\nOf course, the effectiveness of these techniques depends on how testers perceive\\na plausible fault. If real faults in an OO system are perceived to be implausible, then\\nthis approach is really no better than any random testing technique. However, if the\\nanalysis and design models can provide insight into what is likely to go wrong, then\\nfault-based testing can find significant numbers of errors with relatively low expen-\\nditures of effort.\\nIntegration testing looks for plausible faults in operation calls or message connec-\\ntions. Three types of faults are encountered in this context: unexpected result, wrong\\noperation/message used, and incorrect invocation. To determine plausible faults as\\nfunctions (operations) are invoked, the behavior of the operation must be examined.\\nIntegration testing applies to attributes as well as to operations. The “behaviors”\\nof an object are defined by the values that its attributes are assigned. Testing should\\nexercise the attributes to determine whether proper values occur for distinct types of\\nobject behavior.\\nIt is important to note that integration testing attempts to find errors in the client\\nobject, not the server. Stated in conventional terms, the focus of integration testing is\\nto determine whether errors exist in the calling code, not the called code. The operation\\ncall is used as a clue, a way to find test requirements that exercise the calling code.\\n19.4.4 Test Cases and the Class Hierarchy\\nInheritance does not obviate the need for thorough testing of all derived classes.

That\\nis, the structure that is immediately obvious to an end user. Rather than performing\\nfunctions, the users of many OO systems may be given objects to manipulate in some\\nway. But whatever the interface, tests are still based on user tasks. Capturing these\\ntasks involves understanding, watching, and talking with representative users (and\\nas many nonrepresentative users as are worth considering).\\nThere will surely be some difference in detail. For example, in a conventional sys-\\ntem with a command-oriented interface, the user might use the list of all commands\\nas a testing checklist. If no test scenarios existed to exercise a command, testing has\\nlikely overlooked some user tasks (or the interface has useless commands). In an\\nobject-based interface, the tester might use the list of all objects as a testing checklist.\\nThe best tests are derived when the designer looks at the system in a new or\\nunconventional way. For example, if the system or product has a command-based\\ninterface, more thorough tests will be derived if the test-case designer pretends that\\noperations are independent of objects. Ask questions like, “Might the user want to\\nuse this operation—which applies only to the Scanner object—while working with\\nthe printer?” Whatever the interface style, test-case design that exercises the surface\\nstructure should use both objects and operations as clues leading to overlooked\\ntasks.\\nDeep structure refers to the internal technical details of an OO program, that is, the\\nstructure that is understood by examining the design and/or code. Deep structure\\ntesting is designed to exercise dependencies, behaviors, and communication mech-\\nanisms that have been established as part of the design model for OO software.\\nThe requirements and design models are used as the basis for deep structure test-\\ning. For example, the UML collaboration diagram or the deployment model depicts\\ncollaborations between objects and subsystems that may not be externally visible.\\nThe test-case design then asks: “Have we captured (as a test) some task that exer-\\ncises the collaboration noted on the collaboration diagram? If not, why not?”\\n19.5 T ESTING METHODS APPLICABLE AT THE CLASS LEVEL\\nTesting “in the small” focuses on a single class and the methods that are encapsu-\\nlated by the class. Random testing and partitioning are methods that can be used to\\nexercise a class during OO testing.\\n19.5.1 Random Testing for OO Classes\\nTo provide brief illustrations of these methods, consider a banking application in\\nwhich an Account class has the following operations: open(), setup(), deposit(), with-\\ndraw(), balance(), summarize(), creditLimit(), and close() [Kir94]. Each of these opera-\\ntions may be applied for Account,but certain constraints (e.g., the account must be\\nopened before other operations can be applied and closed after all operations are\\n522 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nTesting surface\\nstructure is analogous\\nto black-box testing.\\nDeep structure testing\\nis similar to white-box\\ntesting.\\nuote:\\n“Be not ashamed\\nof mistakes and\\nthus make them\\ncrimes.”\\nConfucius\\nThe number of possible\\npermutations for\\nrandom testing can\\ngrow quite large.\\nA strategy similar to\\northogonal array\\ntesting can be used\\nto improve testing\\nefficiency.\\npre75977_ch19.qxd  11/27/08  6:13 PM  Page 522'),\n",

Input and output are categorized and test cases are designed to exercise each\\ncategory. But how are the partitioning categories derived?\\nState-based partitioning categorizes class operations based on their ability to\\nchange the state of the class. Again considering the Accountclass, state operations\\ninclude deposit() and withdraw(), whereas nonstate operations include balance(),\\nsummarize(), and creditLimit(). Tests are designed in a way that exercises operations\\nthat change state and those that do not change state separately. Therefore,\\nTest case p1: open•setup•deposit•deposit•withdraw•withdraw•close\\nTest case p2: open•setup•deposit•summarize•creditLimit•withdraw•close\\nTest case p 1 changes state, while test case p 2 exercises operations that do not\\nchange state (other than those in the minimum test sequence).\\nAttribute-based partitioning categorizes class operations based on the attributes\\nthat they use. For the Accountclass, the attributes balance and creditLimit can be used\\nto define partitions. Operations are divided into three partitions: (1) operations that\\nuse creditLimit, (2) operations that modify creditLimit\\n, and (3) operations that do not\\nuse or modify creditLimit. Test sequences are then designed for each partition.\\nCategory-based partitioningcategorizes class operations based on the generic func-\\ntion that each performs. For example, operations in theAccount class can be catego-\\nrized in initialization operations (open, setup ), computational operations (deposit,\\nwithdraw), queries (balance, summarize, creditLimit), and termination operations (close).\\n19.6 I NTERCLASS TEST -C ASE DESIGN\\nTest-case design becomes more complicated as integration of the object-oriented\\nsystem begins. It is at this stage that testing of collaborations between classes must\\nbegin. To illustrate “interclass test-case generation” [Kir94], we expand the banking\\nexample introduced in Section 19.5 to include the classes and collaborations noted\\nin Figure 19.2. The direction of the arrows in the figure indicates the direction of mes-\\nsages, and the labeling indicates the operations that are invoked as a consequence\\nof the collaborations implied by the messages.\\nLike the testing of individual classes, class collaboration testing can be accom-\\nplished by applying random and partitioning methods, as well as scenario-based\\ntesting and behavioral testing.\\n19.6.1 Multiple Class Testing\\nKirani and Tsai [Kir94] suggest the following sequence of steps to generate multiple\\nclass random test cases:\\n1. For each client class, use the list of class operations to generate a series of ran-\\ndom test sequences. The operations will send messages to other server classes.\\n524 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nWhat testing\\noptions are\\navailable at the\\nclass level?\\n?\\nuote:\\n“The boundary that\\ndefines the scope of\\nunit and integration\\ntesting is different\\nfor object-oriented\\ndevelopment.

For each of the messages, determine the next level of operations that are\\ninvoked and incorporate these into the test sequence.\\nTo illustrate [Kir94], consider a sequence of operations for the Bankclass relative\\nto an ATM class (Figure 19.2):\\nverifyAcct•verifyPIN•[[verifyPolicy•withdrawReq]|depositReq|acctInfoREQ] n\\nA random test case for the Bank class might be\\nTest case r3 /H11005verifyAcct•verifyPIN•depositReq\\nIn order to consider the collaborators involved in this test, the messages associ-\\nated with each of the operations noted in test case r3 are considered.

In this con-\\ntext, breadth-first implies that a test case exercises a single transition and that when\\na new transition is to be tested only previously tested transitions are used.\\nConsider a CreditCard object that is part of the banking system. The initial state\\nof CreditCard is undefined (i.e., no credit card number has been provided). Upon\\nreading the credit card during a sale, the object takes on a defined state; that is, the\\nattributes card number and expiration date, along with bank-specific identifiers are\\ndefined. The credit card is submitted when it is sent for authorization, and it is\\napproved when authorization is received. The transition of CreditCard from one\\nstate to another can be tested by deriving test cases that cause the transition to oc-\\ncur. A breadth-first approach to this type of testing would not exercisesubmitted be-\\nfore it exercised undefined and defined. If it did, it would make use of transitions that\\nhad not been previously tested and would therefore violate the breadth-first criterion.\\n19.7 S UMMARY\\nThe overall objective of object-oriented testing—to find the maximum number of\\nerrors with a minimum amount of effort is identical to the objective of conventional\\nsoftware testing. But the strategy and tactics for OO testing differ significantly. The\\nview of testing broadens to include the review of both the requirements and design\\nmodel. In addition, the focus of testing moves away from the procedural component\\n(the module) and toward the class.\\nBecause the OO requirements and design models and the resulting source code\\nare semantically coupled, testing (in the form of technical reviews) begins during the\\nmodeling activity. For this reason, the review of CRC, object-relationship, and object-\\nbehavior models can be viewed as first-stage testing.\\nOnce code is available, unit testing is applied for each class. The design of tests\\nfor a class uses a variety of methods: fault-based testing, random testing, and parti-\\ntion testing. Each of these methods exercise the operations encapsulated by the\\nclass. Test sequences are designed to ensure that relevant operations are exercised.\\nThe state of the class, represented by the values of its attributes, is examined to\\ndetermine if errors exist.\\nIntegration testing can be accomplished using a thread-based or use-based strat-\\negy. Thread-based testing integrates the set of classes that collaborate to respond to\\none input or event. Use-based testing constructs the system in layers, beginning with\\nthose classes that do not make use of server classes. Integration test-case design\\nmethods can also make use of random and partition tests. In addition, scenario-\\nbased testing and tests derived from behavioral models can be used to test a class\\nCHAPTER 19 TESTING OBJECT-ORIENTED APPLICATIONS 527\\npre75977_ch19.qxd  11/27/08  6:13 PM  Page 527'),\n",

I also consider the nature of the errors that are encountered as a\\nconsequence of testing, and the testing strategy that is applied to uncover these\\nerrors.\\n20.1.1 Dimensions of Quality\\nQuality is incorporated into a Web application as a consequence of good design. It is\\nevaluated by applying a series of technical reviews that assess various elements of\\nthe design model and by applying a testing process that is discussed throughout this\\nchapter. Both reviews and testing examine one or more of the following quality\\ndimensions [Mil00a]:\\n• Content is evaluated at both a syntactic and semantic level. At the syntactic\\nlevel, spelling, punctuation, and grammar are assessed for text-based\\ndocuments. At a semantic level, correctness (of information presented),\\nconsistency (across the entire content object and related objects), and lack of\\nambiguity are all assessed.\\n• Function is tested to uncover errors that indicate lack of conformance to\\ncustomer requirements. Each WebApp function is assessed for correctness,\\ninstability, and general conformance to appropriate implementation\\nstandards (e.g., Java or AJAX language standards).\\n• Structure is assessed to ensure that it properly delivers WebApp content and\\nfunction, that it is extensible, and that it can be supported as new content or\\nfunctionality is added.\\n• Usabilityis tested to ensure that each category of user is supported by the\\ninterface and can learn and apply all required navigation syntax and semantics.\\n• Navigability is tested to ensure that all navigation syntax and semantics are\\nexercised to uncover any navigation errors (e.g., dead links, improper links,\\nerroneous links).\\n530 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\n1 Generic software quality dimensions, equally applicable for WebApps, were discussed in Chapter 14.\\nHow do we\\nassess\\nquality within the\\ncontext of a\\nWebApp and its\\nenvironment?\\n?\\nnavigation \\ntesting  . . . . . . .545\\nperformance \\ntesting  . . . . . . .550\\nplanning . . . . . .532\\nsecurity \\ntesting  . . . . . . .548\\nstrategy . . . . . .532\\nstress testing  . .552\\nusability tests . .540\\npre75977_ch20.qxd  11/28/08  10:22 AM  Page 530'),\n",

Because many types of WebApp tests uncover problems that are first\\nevidenced on the client side (i.e., via an interface implemented on a specific\\nbrowser or a personal communication device), you often see a symptom of\\nthe error, not the error itself.\\n2. Because a WebApp is implemented in a number of different configurations\\nand within different environments, it may be difficult or impossible to repro-\\nduce an error outside the environment in which the error was originally\\nencountered.\\n3. Although some errors are the result of incorrect design or improper HTML\\n(or other programming language) coding, many errors can be traced to the\\nWebApp configuration.\\n4. Because WebApps reside within a client-server architecture, errors can be\\ndifficult to trace across three architectural layers: the client, the server, or the\\nnetwork itself.\\n5. Some errors are due to the static operating environment (i.e., the specific con-\\nfiguration in which testing is conducted), while others are attributable to the\\ndynamic operating environment (i.e., instantaneous resource loading or\\ntime-related errors).\\nThese five error attributes suggest that environment plays an important role in the\\ndiagnosis of all errors uncovered during the WebApp testing. In some situations (e.g.,\\ncontent testing), the site of the error is obvious, but in many other types of WebApp\\ntesting (e.g., navigation testing, performance testing, security testing) the underlying\\ncause of the error may be considerably more difficult to determine.\\nCHAPTER 20 TESTING WEB APPLICATIONS 531\\nuote:\\n“Innovation is a\\nbittersweet deal for\\nsoftware testers.\\nJust when it seems\\nthat we know how\\nto test a particular\\ntechnology, a new\\none [WebApps]\\ncomes along and\\nall bets are off.”\\nJames Bach\\nWhat makes\\nerrors\\nencountered\\nduring WebApp\\nexecution\\nsomewhat\\ndifferent from\\nthose encountered\\nfor conventional\\nsoftware?\\n?\\npre75977_ch20.qxd  11/28/08  10:22 AM  Page 531'),\n",

The interface model is reviewed to ensure that all use cases can be accom-\\nmodated.\\n3. The design model for the WebApp is reviewed to uncover navigation errors.\\n4. The user interface is tested to uncover errors in presentation and/or naviga-\\ntion mechanics.\\n5. Functional components are unit tested.\\n6. Navigation throughout the architecture is tested.\\n7.

Security tests are conducted in an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the\\nWebApp or within its environment.\\n9. Performance tests are conducted.\\n10. The WebApp is tested by a controlled and monitored population of end users;\\nthe results of their interaction with the system are evaluated for content and\\nnavigation errors, usability concerns, compatibility concerns, and WebApp\\nsecurity, reliability, and performance.\\nBecause many WebApps evolve continuously, the testing process is an ongoing ac-\\ntivity, conducted by Web support staff who use regression tests derived from the tests\\ndeveloped when the WebApp was first engineered.\\n20.1.4 Test Planning\\nThe use of the word planning (in any context) is anathema to some Web developers.\\nThese developers don’t plan; they just start—hoping that a killer WebApp will\\nemerge. A more disciplined approach recognizes that planning establishes a road\\nmap for all work that follows. It’s worth the effort. In their book on WebApp testing,\\nSplaine and Jaskiel [Spl01] state:\\nExcept for the simplest of Web sites, it quickly becomes apparent that some sort of test\\nplanning is needed. All too often, the initial number of bugs found from ad hoc testing is\\nlarge enough that not all of them are fixed the first time they’re detected. This puts an\\nadditional burden on people who test Web sites and applications. Not only must they\\nconjure up imaginative new tests, but they must also remember how previous tests were\\nexecuted in order to reliably re-test the Web site/application, and ensure that known\\nbugs have been removed and that no new bugs have been introduced.\\n532 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nThe overall strategy for\\nWebApp testing can\\nbe summarized in the\\n10 steps noted here.\\nWebRef\\nExcellent articles on\\nWebApp testing can\\nbe found at www\\n.stickyminds.com/\\ntesting.asp\\npre75977_ch20.qxd  11/28/08  10:22 AM  Page 532'),\n",

Content testing attempts to uncover these and many other problems\\nbefore the user encounters them.\\nContent testing combines both reviews and the generation of executable test\\ncases. Reviews are applied to uncover semantic errors in content (discussed in Sec-\\ntion 20.3.1). Executable testing is used to uncover content errors that can be traced\\nto dynamically derived content that is driven by data acquired from one or more\\ndatabases.\\n20.3.1 Content Testing Objectives\\nContent testing has three important objectives: (1) to uncover syntactic errors (e.g.,\\ntypos, grammar mistakes) in text-based documents, graphical representations, and\\nother media; (2) to uncover semantic errors (i.e., errors in the accuracy or com-\\npleteness of information) in any content object presented as navigation occurs, and\\n(3) to find errors in the organization or structure of content that is presented to the\\nend user.\\nTo accomplish the first objective, automated spelling and grammar checkers may\\nbe used. However, many syntactic errors evade detection by such tools and must be\\ndiscovered by a human reviewer (tester). In fact, a large website might enlist the\\nservices of a professional copy editor to uncover typographical errors, grammatical\\nmistakes, errors in content consistency, errors in graphical representations, and\\ncross-referencing errors.\\nSemantic testing focuses on the information presented within each content\\nobject. The reviewer (tester) must answer the following questions:\\n• Is the information factually accurate?\\n• Is the information concise and to the point?\\n• Is the layout of the content object easy for the user to understand?\\n• Can information embedded within a content object be found easily?\\n• Have proper references been provided for all information derived from other\\nsources?\\n• Is the information presented consistent internally and consistent with infor-\\nmation presented in other content objects?\\n• Is the content offensive, misleading, or does it open the door to litigation?\\n• Does the content infringe on existing copyrights or trademarks?\\n534 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nContent testing\\nobjectives are: (1) to\\nuncover syntactic errors\\nin content, (2) to\\nuncover semantic\\nerrors, and (3) to find\\nstructural errors.\\nAlthough technical\\nreviews are not a part\\nof testing, content\\nreview should be\\nperformed to ensure\\nthat content has quality.\\nWhat\\nquestions\\nshould be asked\\nand answered to\\nuncover semantic\\nerrors in content?\\n?\\npre75977_ch20.qxd  11/28/08  10:22 AM  Page 534'),\n",

Are\\nthe links correct?\\n• Does the aesthetic style of the content conflict with the aesthetic style of the\\ninterface?\\nObtaining answers to each of these questions for a large WebApp (containing\\nhundreds of content objects) can be a daunting task. However, failure to uncover\\nsemantic errors will shake the user’s faith in the WebApp and can lead to failure of\\nthe Web-based application.\\nContent objects exist within an architecture that has a specific style (Chapter 13).\\nDuring content testing, the structure and organization of the content architecture is\\ntested to ensure that required content is presented to the end user in the proper\\norder and relationships. For example, the SafeHomeAssured.comWebApp presents\\na variety of information about sensors that are used as part of security and\\nsurveillance products. Content objects provide descriptive information, technical\\nspecifications, a photographic representation, and related information. Tests of the\\nSafeHomeAssured.com content architecture strive to uncover errors in the presen-\\ntation of this information (e.g., a description of Sensor X is presented with a photo\\nof Sensor Y).\\n20.3.2 Database Testing\\nModern WebApps do much more than present static content objects. In many appli-\\ncation domains, WebApps interface with sophisticated database management\\nsystems and build dynamic content objects that are created in real time using the\\ndata acquired from a database.\\nFor example, a financial services WebApp can produce complex text-based, tab-\\nular, and graphical information about a specific equity (e.g., a stock or mutual fund).\\nThe composite content object that presents this information is created dynamically\\nafter the user has made a request for information about a specific equity. To accom-\\nplish this, the following steps are required: (1) a large equities database is queried,\\n(2) relevant data are extracted from the database, (3) the extracted data must be\\norganized as a content object, and (4) this content object (representing customized\\ninformation requested by an end user) is transmitted to the client environment for\\ndisplay. Errors can and do occur as a consequence of each of these steps. The\\nobjective of database testing is to uncover these errors, but database testing is com-\\nplicated by a variety of factors:\\n1. The original client-side request for information is rarely presented in the form\\n[e.g., structured query language (SQL)] that can be input to a database manage-\\nment system (DBMS). Therefore, tests should be designed to uncover errors\\nmade in translating the user’s request into a form that can be processed by\\nthe DBMS.\\nCHAPTER 20 TESTING WEB APPLICATIONS 535\\nWhat issues\\ncomplicate\\ndatabase testing\\nfor WebApps?\\n?\\nuote:\\n“In general, the\\nsoftware testing\\ntechniques that are\\napplied to other\\napplications are\\nthe same as those\\napplied to Web-based\\napplications. . . .\\nThe difference . . . is\\nthat the technology\\nvariables in the\\nWeb environment\\nmultiply.”\\nHung Nguyen\\npre75977_ch20.qxd  11/28/08  10:22 AM  Page 535'),\n",

Black-box tests are conducted to uncover any errors in\\nprocessing as the script is executed.

Black-box tests are conducted with an emphasis on data integrity\\n(as data are passed to the CGI script) and script processing (once validated data have\\nbeen received). In addition, performance testing can be conducted to ensure that the\\nserver-side configuration can accommodate the processing demands of multiple\\ninvocations of CGI scripts [Spl01].\\nStreaming content. Tests should demonstrate that streaming data are up-to-date,\\nproperly displayed, and can be suspended without error and restarted without difficulty.\\nCookies. Both server-side and client-side testing are required.

In addition, the proper persistence of the cookie is tested to ensure that\\nits expiration date is correct.

Interface semantics testing “eval-\\nuates how well the design takes care of users, offers clear direction, delivers feed-\\nback, and maintains consistency of language and approach” [Ngu00].\\nA thorough review of the interface design model can provide partial answers to\\nthe questions implied by the preceding paragraph. However, each use-case scenario\\n(for each user category) should be tested once the WebApp has been implemented.\\nIn essence, a use case becomes the input for the design of a testing sequence. The\\nintent of the testing sequence is to uncover errors that will preclude a user from\\nachieving the objective associated with the use case.\\nAs each use case is tested, it’s a good idea to maintain a checklist to ensure that\\nevery menu item has been exercised at least one time and that every embedded link\\nwithin a content object has been used. In addition, the test series should include\\nimproper menu selection and link usage. The intent is to determine whether the\\nWebApp provides effective error handling and recovery.\\n20.4.4 Usability Tests\\nUsability testing is similar to interface semantics testing (Section 20.4.3) in the sense\\nthat it also evaluates the degree to which users can interact effectively with the WebApp\\nand the degree to which the WebApp guides users’ actions, provides meaningful feed-\\nback, and enforces a consistent interaction approach. Rather than focusing intently on\\nthe semantics of some interactive objective, usability reviews and tests are designed to\\ndetermine the degree to which the WebApp interface makes the user’s life easy.\\n6\\n540 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nWebRef\\nA worthwhile guide\\nto usability testing can\\nbe found at\\nwww.ahref.com/\\nguides/design/\\n199806/0615jef\\n.html.\\n6 The term user-friendliness has been used in this context.

The following test categories and\\nobjectives (written in the form of a question) illustrate this approach:\\n7\\nInteractivity—Are interaction mechanisms (e.g., pull-down menus, buttons,\\npointers) easy to understand and use?\\nLayout—Are navigation mechanisms, content, and functions placed in a manner\\nthat allows the user to find them quickly?\\nReadability—Is text well written and understandable? 8 Are graphic representa-\\ntions easy to understand?\\nAesthetics—Do layout, color, typeface, and related characteristics lead to ease of\\nuse? Do users “feel comfortable” with the look and feel of the WebApp?\\nDisplay characteristics—Does the WebApp make optimal use of screen size and\\nresolution?\\nTime sensitivity—Can important features, functions, and content be used or\\nacquired in a timely manner?\\nPersonalization—Does the WebApp tailor itself to the specific needs of different\\nuser categories or individual users?\\nAccessibility—Is the WebApp accessible to people who have disabilities?\\nA series of tests is designed within each of these categories.

The input form\\nis assessed to determine what classes of data are relevant for the function.\\nTest cases for each class of input are derived and executed, while other\\nclasses of input are held constant. For example, an e-commerce application\\nmay implement a function that computes shipping charges. Among a variety\\nof shipping information provided via a form is the user’s postal code.

For\\nexample, the shipping calculation function noted previously requests the\\nmaximum number of days required for product delivery. A minimum of\\n2 days and a maximum of 14 are noted on the form. However, boundary\\nvalue tests might input values of 0, 1, 2, 13, 14, and 15 to determine how the\\nfunction reacts to data at and outside the boundaries of valid input.\\n9\\n• Path testing—If the logical complexity of the function is high, 10 path testing\\n(a white-box test-case design method) can be used to ensure that every inde-\\npendent path in the program has been exercised.\\nIn addition to these test-case design methods, a technique called forced error testing\\n[Ngu01] is used to derive test cases that purposely drive the WebApp component into\\nan error condition. The purpose is to uncover errors that occur during error handling\\n(e.g., incorrect or nonexistent error messages, WebApp failure as a consequence of\\nthe error, erroneous output driven by erroneous input, side effects that are related to\\ncomponent processing).\\nEach component-level test case specifies all input values and the expected output\\nto be provided by the component. The actual output produced as a consequence of\\nthe test is recorded for future reference during support and maintenance.\\nIn many situations, the correct execution of a WebApp function is tied to proper\\ninterfacing with a database that may be external to the WebApp. Therefore, database\\ntesting becomes an integral part of the component-testing regime.\\n544 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\n9 In this case, a better input design might eliminate potential errors.

There are many pathways that can be taken, many stops that\\ncan be made, many things to learn and look at, activities to initiate, and decisions\\nto make. This navigation process is predictable in the sense that every visitor has\\na set of objectives when he arrives. At the same time, the navigation process can\\nbe unpredictable because the visitor, influenced by something he sees or learns,\\nmay choose a path or initiate an action that is not typical for the original objec-\\ntive. The job of navigation testing is (1) to ensure that the mechanisms that allow\\nthe WebApp user to travel through the WebApp are all functional and (2) to vali-\\ndate that each navigation semantic unit (NSU) can be achieved by the appropriate\\nuser category.\\n20.6.1 Testing Navigation Syntax\\nThe first phase of navigation testing actually begins during interface testing.\\nNavigation mechanisms are tested to ensure that each performs its intended func-\\ntion. Splaine and Jaskiel [Spl01] suggest that each of the following navigation mech-\\nanisms should be tested:\\n• Navigation links—these mechanisms include internal links within the\\nWebApp, external links to other WebApps, and anchors within a specific Web\\npage. Each link should be tested to ensure that proper content or function-\\nality is reached when the link is chosen.\\n• Redirects—these links come into play when a user requests a nonexistent\\nURL or selects a link whose content has been removed or whose name has\\nchanged. A message is displayed for the user and navigation is redirected to\\nanother page (e.g., the home page). Redirects should be tested by requesting\\nincorrect internal links or external URLs and assessing how the WebApp\\nhandles these requests.\\n• Bookmarks—although bookmarks are a browser function, the WebApp\\nshould be tested to ensure that a meaningful page title can be extracted as\\nthe bookmark is created.\\n• Frames and framesets—each frame contains the content of a specific Web\\npage, and a frameset contains multiple frames and enables the display of\\nmultiple Web pages at the same time. Because it is possible to nest frames\\nand framesets within one another, these navigation and display mechanisms\\nshould be tested for correct content, proper layout and sizing, download\\nperformance, and browser compatibility.\\n• Site maps—a site map provides a complete table of contents for all Web\\npages. Each site map entry should be tested to ensure that the links take the\\nuser to the proper content or functionality.\\nCHAPTER 20 TESTING WEB APPLICATIONS 545\\nuote:\\n“We’re not lost.\\nWe’re locationally\\nchallenged.”\\nJohn M.

Each NSU is defined by a set of navigation paths\\n(called “ways of navigating”) that connect navigation nodes (e.g., Web pages, con-\\ntent objects, or functionality). Taken as a whole, each NSU allows a user to achieve\\nspecific requirements defined by one or more use cases for a user category. Naviga-\\ntion testing exercises each NSU to ensure that these requirements can be achieved.\\nYou should answer the following questions as each NSU is tested:\\n• Is the NSU achieved in its entirety without error?\\n• Is every navigation node (defined for an NSU) reachable within the context of\\nthe navigation paths defined for the NSU?\\n• If the NSU can be achieved using more than one navigation path, has every\\nrelevant path been tested?\\n• If guidance is provided by the user interface to assist in navigation, are direc-\\ntions correct and understandable as navigation proceeds?\\n• Is there a mechanism (other than the browser “back” arrow) for returning to\\nthe preceding navigation node and to the beginning of the navigation path?\\n• Do mechanisms for navigation within a large navigation node (i.e., a long\\nWeb page) work properly?\\n• If a function is to be executed at a node and the user chooses not to provide\\ninput, can the remainder of the NSU be completed?\\n• If a function is executed at a node and an error in function processing occurs,\\ncan the NSU be completed?\\n• Is there a way to discontinue the navigation before all nodes have been\\nreached, but then return to where the navigation was discontinued and\\nproceed from there?\\n• Is every node reachable from the site map?

In addition, the configuration for a given user can change [e.g.,\\noperating system (OS) updates, new ISP and connection speeds] on a regular basis.\\nThe result can be a client-side environment that is prone to errors that are both sub-\\ntle and significant. One user’s impression of the WebApp and the manner in which\\nshe interacts with it can differ significantly from another user’s experience, if both\\nusers are not working within the same client-side configuration.\\nThe job of configuration testing is not to exercise every possible client-side con-\\nfiguration. Rather, it is to test a set of probable client-side and server-side configu-\\nrations to ensure that the user experience will be the same on all of them and to\\nisolate errors that may be specific to a particular configuration.\\n20.7.1 Server-Side Issues\\nOn the server side, configuration test cases are designed to verify that the projected\\nserver configuration [i.e., WebApp server, database server, operating system(s), fire-\\nwall software, concurrent applications] can support the WebApp without error. In\\nessence, the WebApp is installed within the server-side environment and tested to\\nensure that it operates without error.\\nAs server-side configuration tests are designed, you should consider each com-\\nponent of the server configuration. Among the questions that need to be asked and\\nanswered during server-side configuration testing are:\\n• Is the WebApp fully compatible with the server OS?\\n• Are system files, directories, and related system data created correctly when\\nthe WebApp is operational?\\n• Do system security measures (e.g., firewalls or encryption) allow the WebApp\\nto execute and service users without interference or performance degradation?\\nCHAPTER 20 TESTING WEB APPLICATIONS 547\\nWhat\\nquestions\\nmust be asked\\nand answered as\\nserver-side\\nconfiguration\\ntesting is\\nconducted?\\n?\\npre75977_ch20.qxd  11/28/08  10:22 AM  Page 547'),\n",

Each of these domains can be attacked,\\nand it is the job of the security tester to uncover weaknesses that can be exploited by\\nthose with the intent to do so.\\nOn the client side, vulnerabilities can often be traced to preexisting bugs in\\nbrowsers, e-mail programs, or communication software. Nguyen [Ngu01] describes\\na typical security hole:\\nOne of the commonly mentioned bugs is Buffer Overflow, which allows malicious code\\nto be executed on the client machine. For example, entering a URL into a browser that is\\nmuch longer than the buffer size allocated for the URL will cause a memory overwrite\\n(buffer overflow) error if the browser does not have error detection code to validate the\\nlength of the input URL. A seasoned hacker can cleverly exploit this bug by writing a long\\nURL with code to be executed that can cause the browser to crash or alter security\\nsettings (from high to low), or, at worst, to corrupt user data.\\nAnother potential vulnerability on the client side is unauthorized access to cook-\\nies placed within the browser. Websites created with malicious intent can acquire\\ninformation contained within legitimate cookies and use this information in ways\\nthat jeopardize the user’s privacy, or worse, set the stage for identity theft.\\nData communicated between the client and server are vulnerable to spoofing.\\nSpoofing occurs when one end of the communication pathway is subverted by an\\nentity with malicious intent. For example, a user can be spoofed by a malicious\\nwebsite that acts as if it is the legitimate WebApp server (identical look and feel). The\\nintent is to steal passwords, proprietary information, or credit data.\\nOn the server side, vulnerabilities include denial-of-service attacks and malicious\\nscripts that can be passed along to the client side or used to disable server operations.\\nIn addition, server-side databases can be accessed without authorization (data theft).\\nTo protect against these (and many other) vulnerabilities, one or more of the\\nfollowing security elements is implemented [Ngu01]:\\n• Firewall—a filtering mechanism that is a combination of hardware and\\nsoftware that examines each incoming packet of information to ensure that it\\nis coming from a legitimate source, blocking any data that are suspect.\\n• Authentication—a verification mechanism that validates the identity of all\\nclients and servers, allowing communication to occur only when both sides\\nare verified.\\n• Encryption—an encoding mechanism that protects sensitive data by\\nmodifying it in a way that makes it impossible to read by those with\\nmalicious intent.

Nothing is more disconcerting than a WebApp\\nthat responds instantly in some situations, and then seems to go into an infinite wait\\nstate in other situations. All of these occurrences happen on the Web every day, and\\nall of them are performance related.\\nPerformance testing is used to uncover performance problems that can result from\\nlack of server-side resources, inappropriate network bandwidth, inadequate data-\\nbase capabilities, faulty or weak operating system capabilities, poorly designed\\nWebApp functionality, and other hardware or software issues that can lead to\\ndegraded client-server performance. The intent is twofold: (1) to understand how the\\nsystem responds as loading (i.e., number of users, number of transactions, or over-\\nall data volume) increases and (2) to collect metrics that will lead to design modifi-\\ncations to improve performance.\\n20.9.1 Performance Testing Objectives\\nPerformance tests are designed to simulate real-world loading situations. As the\\nnumber of simultaneous WebApp users grows, or the number of online transactions\\nincreases, or the amount of data (downloaded or uploaded) increases, performance\\ntesting will help answer the following questions:\\n• Does the server response time degrade to a point where it is noticeable and\\nunacceptable?\\n• At what point (in terms of users, transactions, or data loading) does perform-\\nance become unacceptable?\\n• What system components are responsible for performance degradation?\\n• What is the average response time for users under a variety of loading\\nconditions?\\n550 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nSome aspects of\\nWebApp performance,\\nat least as it is\\nperceived by the end\\nuser, are difficult to\\ntest.

Each of these testing strategies is considered in the sections\\nthat follow.\\n20.9.2 Load Testing\\nThe intent of load testing is to determine how the WebApp and its server-side\\nenvironment will respond to various loading conditions. As testing proceeds,\\npermutations to the following variables define a set of test conditions:\\nN, number of concurrent users\\nT, number of online transactions per unit of time\\nD, data load processed by the server per transaction\\nIn every case, these variables are defined within normal operating bounds of the\\nsystem. As each test condition is run, one or more of the following measures are\\ncollected: average user response, average time to download a standardized unit of\\ndata, or average time to process a transaction. You should examine these measures\\nto determine whether a precipitous decrease in performance can be traced to a\\nspecific combination of N, T, and D.\\nLoad testing can also be used to assess recommended connection speeds\\nfor users of the WebApp. Overall throughput, P, is computed in the following\\nmanner:\\nP /H11005N /H11003T /H11003D\\nAs an example, consider a popular sports news site. At a given moment, 20,000 con-\\ncurrent users submit a request (a transaction, T ) once every 2 minutes on average.\\nEach transaction requires the WebApp to download a new article that averages 3K\\nbytes in length. Therefore, throughput can be calculated as:\\nP /H11005[20,000 /H11003 0.5 /H110033Kb]/60 /H11005500 Kbytes/sec\\n/H110054 megabits per second\\nThe network connection for the server would therefore have to support this data rate\\nand should be tested to ensure that it does.\\nCHAPTER 20 TESTING WEB APPLICATIONS 551\\nIf a WebApp uses\\nmultiple servers to\\nprovide significant\\ncapacity, load testing\\nmust be performed in\\na multiserver\\nenvironment.\\npre75977_ch20.qxd  11/28/08  10:22 AM  Page 551'),\n",

More\\ngenerally, are users aware that they cannot reach the server?\\n• Does the server queue resource requests and empty the queue once capacity\\ndemands diminish?\\n• Are transactions lost as capacity is exceeded?\\n• Is data integrity affected as capacity is exceeded?\\n• What values of N, T, and D force the server environment to fail? How does\\nfailure manifest itself?

In this testing regime, load is spiked to capacity, then lowered quickly to nor-\\nmal operating conditions, and then spiked again. By bouncing system loading, you\\ncan determine how well the server can marshal resources to meet very high demand\\nand then release them when normal conditions reappear (so that they are ready for\\nthe next spike).\\n552 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nThe intent of stress\\ntesting is to better\\nunderstand how a\\nsystem fails as it is\\nstressed beyond its\\noperational limits.\\nTools Taxonomy for WebApp Testing\\nIn his paper on the testing of e-commerce\\nsystems, Lam [Lam01] presents a useful\\ntaxonomy of automated tools that have direct applicability\\nfor testing in a Web engineering context.

A “box” encapsulates the system (or some aspect of the\\nsystem) at some level of detail. Through a process of elaboration or stepwise refine-\\nment, boxes are refined into a hierarchy where each box has referential trans-\\nparency. That is, “the information content of each box specification is sufficient to\\ndefine its refinement, without depending on the implementation of any other box”\\n[Lin94b]. This enables the analyst to partition a system hierarchically, moving from\\nessential representation at the top to implementation-specific detail at the bottom.\\nThree types of boxes are used:\\nBlack box. The black box specifies the behavior of a system or a part of a\\nsystem. The system (or part) responds to specific stimuli (events) by applying\\na set of transition rules that map the stimulus into a response.\\nState box. The state box encapsulates state data and services (operations)\\nin a manner that is analogous to objects. In this specification view, inputs\\nto the state box (stimuli) and outputs (responses) are represented. The state\\nbox also represents the “stimulus history” of the black box, that is, the data\\nencapsulated in the state box that must be retained between the transitions\\nimplied.\\nClear box. The transition functions that are implied by the state box are\\ndefined in the clear box. Stated simply, a clear box contains the procedural\\ndesign for the state box.\\n560 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nCleanroom emphasizes\\ntests that exercise the\\nway software is really\\nused.

Data abstractions and the operations that manipulate those ab-\\nstractions are encapsulated by the black box.

Recalling the\\ndiscussion of behavioral modeling and state diagrams in Chapter 7, a state is some\\nobservable mode of system behavior. As processing occurs, a system responds to\\nevents (stimuli) by making a transition from the current state to some new state. As\\nthe transition is made, an action may occur. The state box uses a data abstraction to\\ndetermine the transition to the next state and the action (response) that will occur as\\na consequence of the transition.\\nReferring to Figure 21.4 , the state box incorporates a black box g. The stimulus S\\nthat is input to the black box arrives from some external source and a set of internal\\nsystem states T.Mills [Mil88] provides a mathematical description of the function f of\\nthe black box contained within the state box:\\ng : S* /H11003T* → R /H11003T\\nwhere g is a subfunction that is tied to a specific state t. When considered collectively,\\nthe state-subfunction pairs (t, g) define the black-box function f.\\n21.2.3 Clear-Box Specification\\nThe clear-box specification is closely aligned with procedural design and structured\\nprogramming. In essence, the subfunction g within the state box is replaced by the\\nstructured programming constructs that implement g.\\nAs an example, consider the clear box shown in Figure 21.5.

But in this case, structured programming is applied far more\\nrigorously.\\nBasic processing functions (described during earlier refinements of the specifica-\\ntion) are refined using a “stepwise expansion of mathematical functions into\\nstructures of logical connectives [e.g., if-then-else] and subfunctions, where the\\nexpansion [is] carried out until all identified subfunctions could be directly stated in\\nthe programming language used for implementation” [Dye92].\\nThe structured programming approach can be used effectively to refine function,\\nbut what about data design? Here a number of fundamental design concepts\\n(Chapter 8) come into play. Program data are encapsulated as a set of abstractions\\nthat are serviced by subfunctions. The concepts of data encapsulation, information\\nhiding, and data typing are used to create the data design.\\n29.3.1 Design Refinement\\nEach clear-box specification represents the design of a procedure (subfunction)\\nrequired to accomplish a state-box transition. Within the clear box, structured pro-\\ngramming constructs and stepwise refinement are used to represent procedural de-\\ntail. For example, a program function f is refined into a sequence of subfunctions g\\nand h. These in turn are refined into conditional constructs (e.g., if-then-else and do-\\nwhile). Further refinement continues until there is enough procedural detail to create\\nthe component in question.\\nCHAPTER 21 FORMAL MODELING AND VERIFICATION 563\\nS R\\nT\\nState\\ng11 cg1\\ng12\\ng13\\nFIGURE 21.5\\nA clear-box\\nspecification\\npre75977_ch21.qxd  11/27/08  6:18 PM  Page 563'),\n",

Since the cont condition is identical to\\nthe loop condition, loop is true regardless of the flow path that leads to it.\\n3.

This is the first question\\naddressed by statistical use testing.\\nStatistical use testing “amounts to testing software the way users intend to use it”\\n[Lin94b]. To accomplish this, cleanroom testing teams (also called certification teams)\\nmust determine a usage probability distribution for the software. The specification\\n(black box) for each increment of the software is analyzed to define a set of stimuli\\n(inputs or events) that cause the software to change its behavior. Based on inter-\\nviews with potential users, the creation of usage scenarios, and a general under-\\nstanding of the application domain, a probability of use is assigned to each stimuli.\\nTest cases are generated for each set of stimuli\\n4 according to the usage probability\\ndistribution. To illustrate, consider the SafeHomesystem discussed earlier in this book.\\nCleanroom software engineering is being used to develop a software increment that\\nmanages user interaction with the security system keypad. Five stimuli have been iden-\\ntified for this increment. Analysis indicates the percent probability distribution of each\\nstimulus. To make selection of test cases easier, these probabilities are mapped into\\nintervals numbered between 1 and 99 [Lin94] and illustrated in the following table:\\nProgram Stimulus Probability Interval\\nArm/disarm (AD) 50% 1–49\\nZone set (ZS) 15% 50–63\\nQuery (Q) 15% 64–78\\nTest (T) 15% 79–94\\nPanic alarm 5% 95–99\\n566 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nuote:\\n“Quality is not an\\nact, it is a habit.”\\nAristotle\\nEven if you decide\\nagainst the cleanroom\\napproach, it’s worth\\nconsidering statistical\\nuse testing as an\\nintegral part of your\\ntest strategy.\\n4 Automated tools may be used to accomplish this.

Such formal methods provide frameworks within\\nwhich people can specify, develop, and verify systems in a systematic, rather than ad hoc\\nmanner.\\nThe desired properties of a formal specification—consistency, completeness, and\\nlack of ambiguity—are the objectives of all specification methods. However, the\\nmathematically based specification language used for formal methods results in a\\nmuch higher likelihood of achieving these properties. The formal syntax of a speci-\\nfication language (Section 21.7) enables requirements or design to be interpreted in\\nonly one way, eliminating ambiguity that often occurs when a natural language\\n(e.g., English) or a graphical notation (e.g., UML) must be interpreted by a reader. The\\ndescriptive facilities of set theory and logic notation enable a clear statement of\\nrequirements. To be consistent, requirements stated in one place in a specification\\nshould not be contradicted in another place. Consistency is achieved\\n5 by mathemat-\\nically proving that initial facts can be formally mapped (using inference rules) into\\nlater statements within the specification.\\nTo introduce basic formal methods concepts, let’s consider a few simple exam-\\nples to illustrate the use of mathematical specification, without getting bogged down\\nin too much mathematical detail.\\nExample 1: A symbol table. A program is used to maintain a symbol table. Such\\na table is used frequently in many different types of applications. It consists of a col-\\nlection of items without any duplication. An example of a typical symbol table is\\n568 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nuote:\\n“Formal methods\\nhave tremendous\\npotential for\\nimproving the\\nclarity and\\nprecision of\\nrequirements\\nspecifications,\\nand in finding\\nimportant and\\nsubtle errors.”\\nSteve\\nEasterbrook\\net al.\\n5 In reality, completeness is difficult to ensure, even when formal methods are used. Some aspects\\nof a system may be left undefined as the specification is being created; other characteristics may be\\npurposely omitted to allow designers some freedom in choosing an implementation approach; and\\nfinally, it is impossible to consider every operational scenario in a large, complex system. Things\\nmay simply be omitted by mistake.\\npre75977_ch21.qxd  11/27/08  6:18 PM  Page 568'),\n",

It represents the table used by an operating system to hold the\\nnames of the users of the system. Other examples of tables include the collection of\\nnames of staff in a payroll system, the collection of names of computers in a network\\ncommunications system, and the collection of destinations in a system for produc-\\ning transportation timetables.\\nAssume that the table presented in this example consists of no more than MaxIds\\nnames. This statement, which places a constraint on the table, is a component of a\\ncondition known as a data invariant. A data invariant is a condition that is true\\nthroughout the execution of the system that contains a collection of data. The data\\ninvariant that holds for the symbol table just discussed has two components: (1) that\\nthe table will contain no more than MaxIds names and (2) that there will be no du-\\nplicate names in the table. In the case of the symbol table program, this means that\\nno matter when the symbol table is examined during execution of the system, it will\\nalways contain no more than MaxIds names and will contain no duplicates.\\nAnother important concept is that of a state.Many formal languages, such as OCL\\n(Section 21.7.1), use the notion of states as they were discussed in Chapter 7; that is,\\na system can be in one of several states, each representing an externally observable\\nmode of behavior. However, a different definition for the term state is used in the Z\\nlanguage (Section 21.7.2). In Z (and related languages), the state of a system is rep-\\nresented by the system’s stored data (hence, Z suggests a much larger number of\\nstates, representing each possible configuration of the data). Using the latter defini-\\ntion in the example of the symbol table program, the state is the symbol table.\\nThe final concept is that of an operation.This is an action that takes place within a\\nsystem and reads or writes data. If the symbol table program is concerned with adding\\nand removing names from the symbol table, then it will be associated with two oper-\\nations: an operation to add() a specified name to the symbol table and an operation\\nto remove() an existing name from the table.\\n6 If the program provides the facility to\\nCHAPTER 21 FORMAL MODELING AND VERIFICATION 569\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.\\n4.\\n5.\\n6.\\n7.\\n8.\\n9.\\n10.\\nWilson\\nSimpson\\nAbel\\nFernandez\\nMaxIds = 10\\nFIGURE 21.7\\nA symbol table\\nA data invariant is a\\nset of conditions that\\nare true throughout the\\nexecution of the\\nsystem that contains\\na collection of data.\\nAnother way of looking\\nat the notion of the\\nstate is to say that\\ndata determines state.\\nThat is, you can\\nexamine data to see\\nwhat state the system\\nis in.\\n6 It should be noted that adding a name cannot occur in the full state and deleting a name is impos-\\nsible in the empty state.\\npre75977_ch21.qxd  11/27/08  6:18 PM  Page 569'),\n",

An invariant defines what is guaranteed not to change.\\nFor example, the symbol table has an invariant that states that the number of\\nelements is always less than or equal to MaxIds. A precondition defines the circum-\\nstances in which a particular operation is valid. For example, the precondition for an\\noperation that adds a name to a staff identifier symbol table is valid only if the name\\nthat is to be added is not contained in the table and also if there are fewer than\\nMaxIds staff identifiers in the table. The postconditionof an operation defines what is\\nguaranteed to be true upon completion of an operation. This is defined by its effect\\non the data. For the add()operation, the postcondition would specify mathematically\\nthat the table has been augmented with the new identifier.\\nExample 2: A block handler. One of the more important parts of a simple oper-\\nating system is the subsystem that maintains files created by users. Part of the filing\\nsubsystem is the block handler. Files in the file store are composed of blocks of stor-\\nage that are held on a file storage device. During the operation of the computer, files\\nwill be created and deleted, requiring the acquisition and release of blocks of storage.\\nIn order to cope with this, the filing subsystem will maintain a reservoir of unused\\n(free) blocks and keep track of blocks that are currently in use. When blocks are re-\\nleased from a deleted file, they are normally added to a queue of blocks waiting to be\\nadded to the reservoir of unused blocks. This is shown in Figure 21.8. In this figure, a\\nnumber of components are shown: the reservoir of unused blocks, the blocks that\\ncurrently make up the files administered by the operating system, and those blocks\\nthat are waiting to be added to the reservoir.

The\\nsemantic domain of a specification language indicates how the language represents\\nsystem requirements.\\nIt is possible to use different semantic abstractions to describe the same system in\\ndifferent ways. We did this in a less formal fashion in Chapters 6 and 7. Information,\\nfunction, and behavior were each represented. Different modeling notation can be\\nused to represent the same system. The semantics of each representation provides\\ncomplementary views of the system. To illustrate this approach when formal meth-\\nods are used, assume that a formal specification language is used to describe the set\\nof events that cause a particular state to occur in a system. Another formal relation\\ndepicts all functions that occur within a given state. The intersection of these two re-\\nlations provides an indication of the events that will cause specific functions to occur.\\nA variety of formal specification languages are in use today. OCL [OMG03b], Z\\n[ISO02], LARCH [Gut93], and VDM [Jon91] are representative formal specification\\nlanguages that exhibit the characteristics noted previously.

This makes the language more friendly to people who\\nare less mathematically inclined, and more easily processed by computer. But it also\\nmakes OCL a little wordy in places.\\nTo use OCL, you start with one or more UML diagrams—most commonly class, state,\\nor activity diagrams (Appendix 1). OCL expressions are added and state facts about\\nelements of the diagrams. These expressions are called constraints; any implementa-\\ntion derived from the model must ensure each of the constraints always remains true.\\nLike an object-oriented programming language, an OCL expression involves\\noperators operating on objects. However, the result of a complete expression must\\nalways be a Boolean, that is, true or false. The objects can be instances of the OCL\\nCollection class, of which Set and Sequence are two subclasses.\\nThe object selfis the element of the UML diagram in the context of which the OCL\\nexpression is being evaluated. Other objects can be obtained by navigatingusing the\\n. (dot) symbol from the self object. For example: \\n• If self is class C, with attribute a, then self.a evaluates to the object stored in a.\\n• If C has a one-to-many association called assoc to another class D, then\\nself.assoc evaluates to a Set whose elements are of type D.\\n• Finally (and a little more subtly), if D has attribute b, then the expression\\nself.assoc.b evaluates to the set of all the b’s belonging to all D’s.\\nOCL provides built-in operations implementing set and logic operators, constructive\\nspecification, and related mathematics. A small sample of these is presented in\\nTable 21.1.\\nTo illustrate the use of OCL in specification, we reexamine the block handler\\nexample, introduced in Section 21.5. The first step is to develop a UML model\\n(Figure 21.9). This class diagram specifies many relationships among the objects\\ninvolved. However, OCL expressions are added to allow implementers of the system\\nto know more precisely what must remain true as the system runs.\\nCHAPTER 21 FORMAL MODELING AND VERIFICATION 575\\n11\\nBlock BlockSet\\nBlockHandler\\n*\\n*\\n**\\n*\\n1\\n1\\n1\\nblockQueue\\n{orderd}free\\nallBlocks\\n{subset}\\n{subset}\\nused\\nelements\\naddBlock( )\\nremoveBlock( )\\nnumber\\nFIGURE 21.9\\nClass diagram\\nfor a block\\nhandler\\npre75977_ch21.qxd  11/27/08  6:18 PM  Page 575'),\n",

The Z language applies typed sets, relations,\\nand functions within the context of first-order predicate logic to build schemas—a\\nmeans for structuring the formal specification.\\nZ specifications are organized as a set of schemas—a language structure that in-\\ntroduces variables and specifies the relationship between these variables. A schema\\nis essentially the formal specification analog of the programming language compo-\\nnent. Schemas are used to structure a formal specification in the same way that com-\\nponents are used to structure a system.\\nA schema describes the stored data that a system accesses and alters. In the con-\\ntext of Z, this is called the “state.” This usage of the term state in Z is slightly differ-\\nent from the use of the word in the rest of this book.\\n9 In addition, the schema\\nidentifies the operations that are applied to change state and the relationships that\\noccur within the system. The generic structure of a schema takes the form:\\n——— schemaName——————————————\\ndeclarations\\n———————————————————————\\ninvariant\\n————————————————————————\\nCHAPTER 21 FORMAL MODELING AND VERIFICATION 577\\nWebRef\\nDetailed information\\nabout the Z language\\ncan be found at\\nwww.users.cs\\n.york.ac.uk/\\n~susan/abs/\\nz.htm.\\n9 Recall that in other chapters state has been used to identify an externally observable mode of be-\\nhavior for a system.\\npre75977_ch21.qxd  11/27/08  6:18 PM  Page 577'),\n",

It uses box structure specifi-\\ncation for analysis and design modeling and emphasizes correctness verification,\\nrather than testing, as the primary mechanism for finding and removing errors.\\nStatistical use testing is applied to develop the failure rate information necessary to\\ncertify the reliability of delivered software.\\nThe cleanroom approach begins with analysis and design models that use a box\\nstructure representation. A “box” encapsulates the system (or some aspect of the\\nsystem) at a specific level of abstraction. Black boxes are used to represent the\\nexternally observable behavior of a system. State boxes encapsulate state data and\\noperations. A clear box is used to model the procedural design that is implied by the\\ndata and operations of a state box.\\nCorrectness verification is applied once the box structure design is complete. The\\nprocedural design for a software component is partitioned into a series of subfunc-\\ntions. To prove the correctness of the subfunctions, exit conditions are defined for\\neach subfunction and a set of subproofs is applied. If each exit condition is satisfied,\\nthe design must be correct.\\nOnce correctness verification is complete, statistical use testing commences.\\nUnlike conventional testing, cleanroom software engineering does not emphasize\\nunit or integration testing. Rather, the software is tested by defining a set of usage\\nscenarios, determining the probability of use for each scenario, and then defining\\nrandom tests that conform to the probabilities.

If each SCI simply\\nled to other SCIs, little confusion would result. Unfortunately, another variable en-\\nters the process—change. Change may occur at any time, for any reason. In fact, the\\nFirst Law of System Engineering [Ber80] states: “No matter where you are in the sys-\\ntem life cycle, the system will change, and the desire to change it will persist\\nthroughout the life cycle.”\\nWhat is the origin of these changes? The answer to this question is as varied as\\nthe changes themselves. However, there are four fundamental sources of change:\\n• New business or market conditions dictate changes in product requirements\\nor business rules.\\n• New stakeholder needs demand modification of data produced by informa-\\ntion systems, functionality delivered by products, or services delivered by a\\ncomputer-based system.\\n• Reorganization or business growth/downsizing causes changes in project\\npriorities or software engineering team structure.\\n• Budgetary or scheduling constraints cause a redefinition of the system or\\nproduct.\\nCHAPTER 22 SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT 585\\nsoftware\\nconfiguration items\\n(SCIs)  . . . . . . .589\\nstatus \\nreporting  . . . . .600\\nversion \\ncontrol  . . . . . . .595\\nWebApp\\nconfiguration \\nobjects . . . . . . .603\\nWebApps  . . . . .601\\nuote:\\n“There is nothing\\npermanent except\\nchange.”\\nHeraclitus,\\n500\\nB.C.\\nWhat is the\\norigin of\\nchanges that are\\nrequested for\\nsoftware?\\n?\\npre75977_ch22.qxd  11/27/08  6:20 PM  Page 585'),\n",

SCM can be\\nviewed as a software quality assurance activity that is applied throughout the soft-\\nware process. In the sections that follow, I describe major SCM tasks and important\\nconcepts that can help you to manage change.\\n22.1.1 An SCM Scenario 1\\nA typical CM operational scenario involves a project manager who is in charge of a\\nsoftware group, a configuration manager who is in charge of the CM procedures and\\npolicies, the software engineers who are responsible for developing and maintain-\\ning the software product, and the customer who uses the product. In the scenario,\\nassume that the product is a small one involving about 15,000 lines of code being de-\\nveloped by a team of six people. (Note that other scenarios of smaller or larger teams\\nare possible, but, in essence, there are generic issues that each of these projects face\\nconcerning CM.)\\nAt the operational level, the scenario involves various roles and tasks. For the\\nproject manager, the goal is to ensure that the product is developed within a certain\\ntime frame. Hence, the manager monitors the progress of development and recog-\\nnizes and reacts to problems. This is done by generating and analyzing reports about\\nthe status of the software system and by performing reviews on the system.\\nThe goals of the configuration manager are to ensure that procedures and poli-\\ncies for creating, changing, and testing of code are followed, as well as to make\\ninformation about the project accessible. To implement techniques for maintaining\\ncontrol over code changes, this manager introduces mechanisms for making official\\nrequests for changes, for evaluating them (via a Change Control Board that is\\nresponsible for approving changes to the software system), and for authorizing\\nchanges. The manager creates and disseminates task lists for the engineers and\\nbasically creates the project context. Also, the manager collects statistics about com-\\nponents in the software system, such as information determining which components\\nin the system are problematic.\\nFor the software engineers, the goal is to work effectively. This means engineers\\ndo not unnecessarily interfere with each other in the creation and testing of code and\\nin the production of supporting work products. But, at the same time, they try to com-\\nmunicate and coordinate efficiently. Specifically, engineers use tools that help build\\na consistent software product. They communicate and coordinate by notifying one\\nanother about tasks required and tasks completed. Changes are propagated across\\neach other’s work by merging files. Mechanisms exist to ensure that, for components\\nthat undergo simultaneous changes, there is some way of resolving conflicts and\\n586 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\n1 This section is extracted from [Dar01].

The project\\nmanager sees CM as an auditing mechanism; the configuration manager sees it as a\\ncontrolling, tracking, and policy making mechanism; the software engineer sees it\\nas a changing, building, and access control mechanism; and the customer sees it as\\na quality assurance mechanism.\\n22.1.2 Elements of a Configuration Management System\\nIn her comprehensive white paper on software configuration management, Susan\\nDart [Dar01] identifies four important elements that should exist when a configura-\\ntion management system is developed:\\n• Component elements—a set of tools coupled within a file management system\\n(e.g., a database) that enables access to and management of each software\\nconfiguration item.\\n• Process elements—a collection of actions and tasks that define an effective\\napproach to change management (and related activities) for all \\nconstituencies involved in the management, engineering, and use of\\ncomputer software.\\n• Construction elements—a set of tools that automate the construction of\\nsoftware by ensuring that the proper set of validated components (i.e., the\\ncorrect version) have been assembled.\\n• Human elements—a set of tools and process features (encompassing other\\nCM elements) used by the software team to implement effective SCM.\\nThese elements (to be discussed in more detail in later sections) are not mutually\\nexclusive. For example, component elements work in conjunction with construction\\nelements as the software process evolves. Process elements guide many human\\nactivities that are related to SCM and might therefore be considered human elements\\nas well.\\n22.1.3 Baselines\\nChange is a fact of life in software development. Customers want to modify require-\\nments. Developers want to modify the technical approach. Managers want to mod-\\nify the project strategy. Why all this modification?

This additional\\nknowledge is the driving force behind most changes and leads to a statement of fact\\nthat is difficult for many software engineering practitioners to accept: Most changes\\nare justified!\\nA baseline is a software configuration management concept that helps you to con-\\ntrol change without seriously impeding justifiable change. The IEEE (IEEE Std. No.\\n610.12-1990) defines a baseline as:\\nA specification or product that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon, that there-\\nafter serves as the basis for further development, and that can be changed only through\\nformal change control procedures.\\nBefore a software configuration item becomes a baseline, changes may be made\\nquickly and informally.

A baseline is marked by the delivery of one or more software configuration\\nitems that have been approved as a consequence of a technical review (Chapter 15).\\nFor example, the elements of a design model have been documented and reviewed.\\nErrors are found and corrected. Once all parts of the model have been reviewed,\\ncorrected, and then approved, the design model becomes a baseline. Further changes\\nto the program architecture (documented in the design model) can be made only after\\neach has been evaluated and approved.

After SCIs are re-\\nviewed and approved, they are placed in a project database (also called a project\\nlibrary or software repository and discussed in Section 22.2). When a member of a\\nsoftware engineering team wants to make a modification to a baselined SCI, it is\\ncopied from the project database into the engineer’s private workspace. However,\\nthis extracted SCI can be modified only if SCM controls (discussed later in this\\nchapter) are followed. The arrows in Figure 22.1 illustrate the modification path\\nfor a baselined SCI.\\n22.1.4 Software Configuration Items\\nI have already defined a software configuration item as information that is created\\nas part of the software engineering process. In the extreme, a SCI could be consid-\\nered to be a single section of a large specification or one test case in a large suite of\\ntests. More realistically, an SCI is all or part of a work product (e.g., a document, an\\nentire suite of test cases, or a named program component).\\nIn addition to the SCIs that are derived from software work products, many soft-\\nware engineering organizations also place software tools under configuration con-\\ntrol. That is, specific versions of editors, compilers, browsers, and other automated\\ntools are “frozen” as part of the software configuration. Because these tools were\\nused to produce documentation, source code, and data, they must be available when\\nchanges to the software configuration are to be made. Although problems are rare,\\nit is possible that a new version of a tool (e.g., a compiler) might produce different\\nresults than the original version. For this reason, tools, like the software that they\\nhelp to produce, can be baselined as part of a comprehensive configuration man-\\nagement process.\\nIn reality, SCIs are organized to form configuration objects that may be cata-\\nloged in the project database with a single name. A configuration object has a\\nname, attributes, and is “connected” to other objects by relationships. Referring to\\nFigure 22.2, the configuration objects, DesignSpecification, DataModel,\\nComponentN, SourceCode, and TestSpecification are each defined sepa-\\nrately. However, each of the objects is related to the others as shown by the\\narrows. A curved arrow indicates a compositional relation. That is, DataModel\\nand ComponentN are part of the object DesignSpecification. A double-headed\\nstraight arrow indicates an interrelationship. If a change were made to the\\nSourceCode object, the interrelationships enable you to determine what other\\nobjects (and SCIs) might be affected.\\n2\\nCHAPTER 22 SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT 589\\nBe sure that the\\nproject database is\\nmaintained in a\\ncentralized, controlled\\nlocation.\\n2 These relationships are defined within the database.

This approach was problematic for\\nmany reasons: (1) finding a configuration item when it was needed was often diffi-\\ncult, (2) determining which items were changed, when and by whom was often chal-\\nlenging, (3) constructing a new version of an existing program was time consuming\\nand error prone, and (4) describing detailed or complex relationships between con-\\nfiguration items was virtually impossible.\\nToday, SCIs are maintained in a project database or repository. Webster’s Dictio-\\nnary defines the word repository as “any thing or person thought of as a center of\\naccumulation or storage.” During the early history of software engineering, the\\nrepository was indeed a person—the programmer who had to remember the loca-\\ntion of all information relevant to a software project, who had to recall information\\nthat was never written down and reconstruct information that had been lost. Sadly,\\nusing a person as “the center for accumulation and storage” (although it conforms\\nto Webster’s definition) does not work very well. Today, the repository is a “thing”—\\na database that acts as the center for both accumulation and storage of software en-\\ngineering information.

As a project progresses, many versions (Section 22.3.2) of individual\\nwork products will be created. The repository must be able to save all of these ver-\\nsions to enable effective management of product releases and to permit developers\\nto go back to previous versions during testing and debugging.\\nThe repository must be able to control a wide variety of object types, including\\ntext, graphics, bit maps, complex documents, and unique objects like screen and re-\\nport definitions, object files, test data, and results. A mature repository tracks ver-\\nsions of objects with arbitrary levels of granularity; for example, a single data\\ndefinition or a cluster of modules can be tracked.\\nDependency tracking and change management.The repository manages a wide\\nvariety of relationships among the data elements stored in it. These include\\nrelationships between enterprise entities and processes, among the parts of an appli-\\ncation design, between design components and the enterprise information architec-\\nture, between design elements and deliverables, and so on. Some of these relationships\\nare merely associations, and some are dependencies or mandatory relationships.\\nThe ability to keep track of all of these relationships is crucial to the integrity of\\nthe information stored in the repository and to the generation of deliverables based\\non it, and it is one of the most important contributions of the repository concept to\\nthe improvement of the software process. For example, if a UML class diagram is\\nmodified, the repository can detect whether related classes, interface descriptions,\\nand code components also require modification and can bring affected SCIs to the\\ndeveloper’s attention.\\nRequirements tracing.

For example, when a new SCI is created, it must be identified.\\nHowever, if no changes are requested for the SCI, the change control layer does not\\napply. The SCI is assigned to a specific version of the software (version control mech-\\nanisms come into play). A record of the SCI (its name, creation date, version desig-\\nnation, etc.) is maintained for configuration auditing purposes and reported to those\\nwith a need to know. In the sections that follow, we examine each of these SCM\\nprocess layers in more detail.\\n22.3.1 Identification of Objects in the Software Configuration\\nTo control and manage software configuration items, each should be separately\\nnamed and then organized using an object-oriented approach. Two types of objects\\ncan be identified [Cho89]: basic objects and aggregate objects.\\n3 A basic objectis a unit\\nof information that you create during analysis, design, code, or test. For example, a\\nbasic object might be a section of a requirements specification, part of a design\\nmodel, source code for a component, or a suite of test cases that are used to exer-\\ncise the code. An aggregate objectis a collection of basic objects and other aggregate\\nobjects. For example, a DesignSpecification is an aggregate object. Conceptually,\\nit can be viewed as a named (identified) list of pointers that specify aggregate objects\\nsuch as ArchitecturalModel and DataModel, and basic objects such as Compo-\\nnentN and UMLClassDiagramN.\\nEach object has a set of distinct features that identify it uniquely: a name, a\\ndescription, a list of resources, and a “realization.” The object name is a character\\nstring that identifies the object unambiguously. The object description is a list of data\\nitems that identify the SCI type (e.g., model element, program, data) represented by\\nthe object, a project identifier, and change and/or version information. Resources\\nare “entities that are provided, processed, referenced or otherwise required by the\\nobject” [Cho89]. For example, data types, specific functions, or even variable names\\nmay be considered to be object resources. The realization is a pointer to the “unit of\\ntext” for a basic object and null for an aggregate object.\\nConfiguration object identification can also consider the relationships that exist\\nbetween named objects. For example, using the simple notation\\nClass diagram /H11021part-of/H11022requirements model;\\nRequirements model /H11021part-of/H11022requirements specification;\\nyou can create a hierarchy of SCIs.\\n594 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nThe interrelationships\\nestablished for\\nconfiguration objects\\nallow you to assess the\\nimpact of change.\\n3 The concept of an aggregate object [Gus89] has been proposed as a mechanism for representing a\\ncomplete version of a software configuration.\\npre75977_ch22.qxd  11/27/08  6:20 PM  Page 594'),\n",

Before an object is baselined, it may change many\\ntimes, and even after a baseline has been established, changes may be quite frequent.\\n22.3.2 Version Control\\nVersion control combines procedures and tools to manage different versions of con-\\nfiguration objects that are created during the software process. A version control sys-\\ntem implements or is directly integrated with four major capabilities: (1) a project\\ndatabase (repository) that stores all relevant configuration objects, (2) a version man-\\nagement capability that stores all versions of a configuration object (or enables any\\nversion to be constructed using differences from past versions), (3) a make facility\\nthat enables you to collect all relevant configuration objects and construct a specific\\nversion of the software. In addition, version control and change control systems of-\\nten implement an issues tracking(also called bug tracking) capability that enables the\\nteam to record and track the status of all outstanding issues associated with each\\nconfiguration object.\\nA number of version control systems establish a change set—a collection of all\\nchanges (to some baseline configuration) that are required to create a specific ver-\\nsion of the software. Dart [Dar91] notes that a change set “captures all changes to all\\nfiles in the configuration along with the reason for changes and details of who made\\nthe changes and when.”\\nA number of named change sets can be identified for an application or system. This\\nenables you to construct a version of the software by specifying the change sets (by\\nname) that must be applied to the baseline configuration. To accomplish this, a system\\nmodeling approach is applied. The system model contains: (1) a template that includes\\na component hierarchy and a “build order” for the components that describes how the\\nsystem must be constructed, (2) construction rules, and (3) verification rules.\\n4\\nA number of different automated approaches to version control have been pro-\\nposed over the last few decades. The primary difference in approaches is the sophis-\\ntication of the attributes that are used to construct specific versions and variants of a\\nsystem and the mechanics of the process for construction.\\nCHAPTER 22 SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT 595\\nEven if the project\\ndatabase provides the\\nability to establish\\nthese relationships,\\nthey are time consum-\\ning to establish and\\ndifficult to keep up-to-\\ndate. Although very\\nuseful for impact\\nanalysis, they are not\\nessential for overall\\nchange management.\\n4 It is also possible to query the system model to assess how a change in one component will impact\\nother components.\\npre75977_ch22.qxd  11/27/08  6:21 PM  Page 595'),\n",

But the forces that make it necessary also make it annoying. We\\nworry about change because a tiny perturbation in the code can create a big failure in the\\nproduct. But it can also fix a big failure or enable wonderful new capabilities. We worry\\nabout change because a single rogue developer could sink the project; yet brilliant ideas\\noriginate in the minds of those rogues, and a burdensome change control process could\\neffectively discourage them from doing creative work.\\nBach recognizes that we face a balancing act. Too much change control and we\\ncreate problems. Too little, and we create other problems.\\nFor a large software project, uncontrolled change rapidly leads to chaos. For such\\nprojects, change control combines human procedures and automated tools to pro-\\nvide a mechanism for the control of change. The change control process is illustrated\\nschematically in Figure 22.5. A change request is submitted and evaluated to assess\\ntechnical merit, potential side effects, overall impact on other configuration objects\\nand system functions, and the projected cost of the change. The results of the eval-\\nuation are presented as a change report, which is used by a change control authority\\n(CCA)—a person or group that makes a final decision on the status and priority of the\\nchange. An engineering change order (ECO) is generated for each approved change.\\nThe ECO describes the change to be made, the constraints that must be respected,\\nand the criteria for review and audit.\\nThe object(s) to be changed can be placed in a directory that is controlled solely\\nby the software engineer making the change. A version control system (see the CVS\\nsidebar) updates the original file once the change has been made. As an alternative,\\n596 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nThe Concurrent Versions System (CVS)\\nThe use of tools to achieve version control is\\nessential for effective change management. The\\nConcurrent Versions System (CVS) is a widely used tool for\\nversion control. Originally designed for source code, but\\nuseful for any text-based file, the CVS system (1) establishes\\na simple repository, (2) maintains all versions of a file in a\\nsingle named file by storing only the differences between\\nprogressive versions of the original file, and (3) protects\\nagainst simultaneous changes to a file by establishing\\ndifferent directories for each developer, thus insulating one\\nfrom another. CVS merges changes when each developer\\ncompletes her work.\\nIt is important to note that CVS is not a “build” system;\\nthat is, it does not construct a specific version of the\\nsoftware. Other tools (e.g., Makefile) must be integrated\\nwith CVS to accomplish this. CVS does not implement a\\nchange control process (e.g., change requests, change\\nreports, bug tracking).\\nEven with these limitations, CVS “is a dominant open-\\nsource network-transparent version control system [that] is\\nuseful for everyone from individual developers to large,\\ndistributed teams” [CVS07]. Its client-server architecture\\nallows users to access files via Internet connections, and its\\nopen-source philosophy makes it available on most\\npopular platforms.\\nCVS is available at no cost for Windows, Mac OS,\\nLINUX, and UNIX environments.

However, even the most suc-\\ncessful control mechanisms track a change only until an ECO is generated. How can\\na software team ensure that the change has been properly implemented? The an-\\nswer is twofold: (1) technical reviews and (2) the software configuration audit.\\nThe technical review (Chapter 15) focuses on the technical correctness of the con-\\nfiguration object that has been modified. The reviewers assess the SCI to determine\\nconsistency with other SCIs, omissions, or potential side effects. A technical review\\nshould be conducted for all but the most trivial changes.\\nA software configuration audit complements the technical review by assessing a\\nconfiguration object for characteristics that are generally not considered during re-\\nview. The audit asks and answers the following questions:\\n1. Has the change specified in the ECO been made? Have any additional modifi-\\ncations been incorporated?\\n2. Has a technical review been conducted to assess technical correctness?\\n3. Has the software process been followed and have software engineering\\nstandards been properly applied?\\n4. Has the change been “highlighted” in the SCI? Have the change date and\\nchange author been specified? Do the attributes of the configuration object\\nreflect the change?\\n5. Have SCM procedures for noting the change, recording it, and reporting it\\nbeen followed?\\n6.

Using\\nthis approach, an engineering team often develops a WebApp increment in a very\\nshort time period using a customer-driven approach. Subsequent increments add\\nadditional content and functionality, and each is likely to implement changes that\\nlead to enhanced content, better usability, improved aesthetics, better navigation,\\nenhanced performance, and stronger security. Therefore, in the agile world of\\nWebApps, change is viewed somewhat differently.\\nIf you’re a member of a WebApp team, you must embrace change. And yet, a typ-\\nical agile team eschews all things that appear to be process-heavy, bureaucratic, and\\nformal. Software configuration management is often viewed (albeit incorrectly) to\\nhave these characteristics. This seeming contradiction is remedied not by rejecting\\nSCM principles, practices, and tools, but rather, by molding them to meet the special\\nneeds of WebApp projects.\\n22.4.1 Dominant Issues\\nAs WebApps become increasing important to business survival and growth, the need\\nfor configuration management grows. Why? Because without effective controls,\\nimproper changes to a WebApp (recall that immediacy and continuous evolution are\\nthe dominant attributes of many WebApps) can lead to: unauthorized posting of new\\nproduct information, erroneous or poorly tested functionality that frustrates visitors\\nto a website, security holes that jeopardize internal company systems, and other eco-\\nnomically unpleasant or even disastrous consequences.\\nThe general strategies for software configuration management (SCM) described\\nin this chapter are applicable, but tactics and tools must be adapted to conform to\\nthe unique nature of WebApps. Four issues [Dar99] should be considered when\\ndeveloping tactics for WebApp configuration management.\\nContent. A typical WebApp contains a vast array of content—text, graphics,\\napplets, scripts, audio/video files, forms, active page elements, tables, streaming\\ndata, and many others. The challenge is to organize this sea of content into a rational\\nset of configuration objects (Section 22.1.4) and then establish appropriate configu-\\nration control mechanisms for these objects. One approach is to model the WebApp\\ncontent using conventional data modeling techniques (Chapter 6), attaching a set of\\nCHAPTER 22 SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT 601\\n7 See [Pre08] for a comprehensive discussion of Web engineering methods.\\nWhat impact\\ndoes\\nuncontrolled\\nchange have on a\\nWebApp?\\n?\\npre75977_ch22.qxd  11/27/08  6:21 PM  Page 601'),\n",

The static/dynamic nature of each object and\\nits projected longevity (e.g., temporary, fixed existence, or permanent object) are\\nexamples of properties that are required to establish an effective SCM approach. For\\nexample, if a content item is changed hourly, it has temporary longevity. The control\\nmechanisms for this item would be different (less formal) than those applied for a\\nforms component that is a permanent object.\\nPeople. Because a significant percentage of WebApp development continues to\\nbe conducted in an ad hoc manner, any person involved in the WebApp can (and\\noften does) create content. Many content creators have no software engineering\\nbackground and are completely unaware of the need for configuration manage-\\nment. As a consequence, the application grows and changes in an uncontrolled\\nfashion.\\nScalability. The techniques and controls applied to a small WebApp do not scale\\nupward well. It is not uncommon for a simple WebApp to grow significantly as\\ninterconnections with existing information systems, databases, data warehouses,\\nand portal gateways are implemented. As size and complexity grow, small changes\\ncan have far-reaching and unintended effects that can be problematic. Therefore, the\\nrigor of configuration control mechanisms should be directly proportional to appli-\\ncation scale.\\nPolitics. Who “owns” a WebApp? This question is argued in companies large and\\nsmall, and its answer has a significant impact on the management and control\\nactivities. In some instances Web developers are housed outside the IT organization,\\ncreating potential communication difficulties. Dart [Dar99] suggests the following\\nquestions to help understand the politics associated with Web engineering:\\n• Who assumes responsibility for the accuracy of the information on the\\nwebsite?\\n• Who ensures that quality control processes have been followed before infor-\\nmation is published to the site?\\n• Who is responsible for making changes?\\n• Who assumes the cost of change?\\nThe answers to these questions help determine the people within an organization\\nwho must adopt a configuration management process for WebApps.\\nConfiguration management for WebApps continues to evolve (e.g., [Ngu06]). A\\nconventional SCM process may be too cumbersome, but a new generation of content\\nmanagement tools that are specifically designed for Web engineering has emerged\\nover the past few years. These tools establish a process that acquires existing infor-\\nmation (from a broad array of WebApp objects), manages changes to the objects,\\nstructures it in a way that enables it to be presented to an end user, and then pro-\\nvides it to the client-side environment for display.\\n602 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nHow do I\\ndetermine\\nwho has\\nresponsibility for\\nWebApp CM?\\n?\\npre75977_ch22.qxd  11/27/08  6:21 PM  Page 602'),\n",

WebApp objects can be identified (as-\\nsigned file names) in any manner that is appropriate for the organization. However,\\nthe following conventions are recommended to ensure that cross-platform compat-\\nibility is maintained: filenames should be limited to 32 characters in length, mixed-\\ncase or all-caps names should be avoided, and the use of underscores in file names\\nshould be avoided. In addition, URL references (links) within a configuration object\\nshould always use relative paths (e.g., ../products/alarmsensors.html).\\nAll WebApp content has format and structure. Internal file formats are dictated by\\nthe computing environment in which the content is stored. However, rendering for-\\nmat (often called display format) is defined by the aesthetic style and design rules\\nestablished for the WebApp. Content structure defines a content architecture; that is,\\nit defines the way in which content objects are assembled to present meaningful\\ninformation to an end user. Boiko [Boi04] defines structure as “maps that you lay\\nover a set of content chunks [objects] to organize them and make them accessible\\nto the people who need them.”\\n22.4.3 Content Management\\nContent management is related to configuration management in the sense that a con-\\ntent management system (CMS) establishes a process (supported by appropriate\\ntools) that acquires existing content (from a broad array of WebApp configuration\\nobjects), structures it in a way that enables it to be presented to an end user, and then\\nprovides it to the client-side environment for display.\\nThe most common use of a content management system occurs when a dynamic\\nWebApp is built. Dynamic WebApps create Web pages “on-the-fly.” That is, the user\\ntypically queries the WebApp requesting specific information. The WebApp queries\\na database, formats the information accordingly, and presents it to the user. For\\nexample, a music company provides a library of CDs for sale. When a user requests a\\nCD or its e-music equivalent, a database is queried and a variety of information about\\nthe artist, the CD (e.g., its cover image or graphics), the musical content, and sample\\naudio are all downloaded and configured into a standard content template. The re-\\nsultant Web page is built on the server side and passed to the client-side browser for\\nexamination by the end user. A generic representation of this is shown in Figure 22.6.\\nIn the most general sense, a CMS “configures” content for the end user by invok-\\ning three integrated subsystems: a collection subsystem, a management subsystem,\\nand a publishing subsystem [Boi04].\\nThe collection subsystem. Content is derived from data and information that\\nmust be created or acquired by a content developer. The collection subsystem\\nencompasses all actions required to create and/or acquire content, and the technical\\nCHAPTER 22 SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT 603\\nuote:\\n“Content\\nmanagement is an\\nantidote to today’s\\ninformation\\nfrenzy.”\\nBob Boiko\\npre75977_ch22.qxd  11/27/08  6:21 PM  Page 603'),\n",

Software engineers use product met-\\nrics to help them build higher-quality software.\\nWhy is it important? There will always be a qual-\\nitative element to the creation of computer soft-\\nware.

This is\\na mistake.\\nAlthough product metrics for computer software are imperfect, they can provide\\nyou with a systematic way to assess quality based on a set of clearly defined rules.\\nThey also provide you with on-the-spot, rather than after-the-fact, insight. This\\nenables you to discover and correct potential problems before they become cata-\\nstrophic defects.\\nIn this chapter, I present measures that can be used to assess the quality of the\\nproduct as it is being engineered. These measures of internal product attributes pro-\\nvide you with a real-time indication of the efficacy of the requirements, design, and\\ncode models; the effectiveness of test cases; and the overall quality of the software\\nto be built.\\n23.1 A F RAMEWORK FOR PRODUCT METRICS\\nAs I noted in the introduction, measurement assigns numbers or symbols to attributes\\nof entities in the real word. To accomplish this, a measurement model encompassing a\\nconsistent set of rules is required. Although the theory of measurement (e.g., [Kyb84])\\nand its application to computer software (e.g., [Zus97]) are topics that are beyond the\\nscope of this book, it is worthwhile to establish a fundamental framework and a set of\\nbasic principles that guide the definition of product metrics for software.\\n23.1.1 Measures, Metrics, and Indicators\\nAlthough the terms measure, measurement,and metricsare often used interchangeably,\\nit is important to note the subtle differences between them. Because measurecan be\\nused either as a noun or a verb, definitions of the term can become confusing. Within\\nthe software engineering context, a measureprovides a quantitative indication of the\\nextent, amount, dimension, capacity, or size of some attribute of a product or process.\\nMeasurement is the act of determining a measure. The IEEE Standard Glossary of Soft-\\nware Engineering Terminology[IEE93b] defines metricas “a quantitative measure of the\\ndegree to which a system, component, or process possesses a given attribute.”\\nWhen a single data point has been collected (e.g., the number of errors uncovered\\nwithin a single software component), a measure has been established.

A software metric relates the individual measures in some way\\n(e.g., the average number of errors found per review or the average number of errors\\nfound per unit test).\\nA software engineer collects measures and develops metrics so that indicators\\nwill be obtained. An indicator is a metric or combination of metrics that provides\\ninsight into the software process, a software project, or the product itself. An indica-\\ntor provides insight that enables the project manager or software engineers to adjust\\nthe process, the project, or the product to make things better.\\n23.1.2 The Challenge of Product Metrics\\nOver the past four decades, many researchers have attempted to develop a single\\nmetric that provides a comprehensive measure of software complexity. Fenton\\n[Fen94] characterizes this research as a search for “the impossible holy grail.”\\nAlthough dozens of complexity measures have been proposed [Zus90], each takes a\\nsomewhat different view of what complexity is and what attributes of a system lead\\nto complexity. By analogy, consider a metric for evaluating an attractive car. Some\\nobservers might emphasize body design; others might consider mechanical charac-\\nteristics; still others might tout cost, or performance, or the use of alternative fuels,\\nor the ability to recycle when the car is junked. Since any one of these characteris-\\ntics may be at odds with others, it is difficult to derive a single value for “attractive-\\nness.” The same problem occurs with computer software.\\nYet there is a need to measure and control software complexity. And if a single\\nvalue of this quality metric is difficult to derive, it should be possible to develop\\nmeasures of different internal program attributes (e.g., effective modularity, func-\\ntional independence, and other attributes discussed in Chapter 8). These measures\\nand the metrics derived from them can be used as independent indicators of the\\nquality of requirements and design models. But here again, problems arise. Fenton\\n[Fen94] notes this when he states: “The danger of attempting to find measures\\nwhich characterize so many different attributes is that inevitably the measures\\nhave to satisfy conflicting aims. This is counter to the representational theory of\\nmeasurement.” Although Fenton’s statement is correct, many people argue that\\nproduct measurement conducted during the early stages of the software process\\nprovides software engineers with a consistent and objective mechanism for\\nassessing quality.\\nIt is fair to ask, however, just how valid product metrics are. That is, how closely\\naligned are product metrics to the long-term reliability and quality of a computer-\\nbased system? Fenton [Fen91] addresses this question in the following way:\\nIn spite of the intuitive connections between the internal structure of software products\\n[product metrics] and its external product and process attributes, there have actually\\nbeen very few scientific attempts to establish specific relationships. There are a number\\nof reasons why this is so; the most commonly cited is the impracticality of conducting rel-\\nevant experiments.\\nCHAPTER 23 PRODUCT METRICS 615\\nAn indicator is a metric\\nor metrics that provide\\ninsight into the\\nprocess, the product,\\nor the project.\\nWebRef\\nVoluminous\\ninformation on\\nproduct metrics has\\nbeen compiled by\\nHorst Zuse at\\nirb.cs.tu-berlin\\n.de/~zuse/.\\nuote:\\n“Just as\\ntemperature\\nmeasurement\\nbegan with an\\nindex finger . . .\\nand grew to\\nsophisticated\\nscales, tools and\\ntechniques, so too\\nis software\\nmeasurement\\nmaturing.”\\nShari Pfleeger\\npre75977_ch23.qxd  11/27/08  6:22 PM  Page 615'),\n",

Roche [Roc94] sug-\\ngests a measurement process that can be characterized by five activities:\\n• Formulation. The derivation of software measures and metrics appropriate for\\nthe representation of the software that is being considered.\\n• Collection. The mechanism used to accumulate data required to derive the\\nformulated metrics.\\n• Analysis. The computation of metrics and the application of mathematical\\ntools.\\n• Interpretation.

Recommendations derived from the interpretation of product\\nmetrics transmitted to the software team.\\nSoftware metrics will be useful only if they are characterized effectively and vali-\\ndated so that their worth is proven. The following principles [Let03b] are represen-\\ntative of many that can be proposed for metrics characterization and validation:\\n• A metric should have desirable mathematical properties. That is, the metric’s\\nvalue should be in a meaningful range (e.g., 0 to 1, where 0 truly means\\nabsence, 1 indicates the maximum value, and 0.5 represents the “halfway\\npoint”). Also, a metric that purports to be on a rational scale should not be\\ncomposed of components that are only measured on an ordinal scale.\\n• When a metric represents a software characteristic that increases when positive\\ntraits occur or decreases when undesirable traits are encountered, the value of\\nthe metric should increase or decrease in the same manner.\\n• Each metric should be validated empirically in a wide variety of contexts before\\nbeing published or used to make decisions. A metric should measure the factor\\nof interest, independently of other factors. It should “scale up” to large\\nsystems and work in a variety of programming languages and system\\ndomains.\\n616 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\n1 Although criticism of specific metrics is common in the literature, many critiques focus on esoteric\\nissues and miss the primary objective of metrics in the real world: to help the software engineer\\nestablish a systematic and objective way to gain insight into his or her work and to improve prod-\\nuct quality as a result.\\nWhat are the\\nsteps of an\\neffective\\nmeasurement\\nprocess?\\n?\\nIn reality, many\\nproduct metrics in use\\ntoday do not conform\\nto these principles as\\nwell as they should.\\nBut that doesn’t mean\\nthat they have no\\nvalue—just be careful\\nwhen you use them,\\nunderstanding that\\nthey are intended to\\nprovide insight, not\\nhard scientific\\nverification.\\npre75977_ch23.qxd  11/27/08  6:22 PM  Page 616'),\n",

GQM emphasizes the need to (1) establish an explicit measurement goal\\nthat is specific to the process activity or product characteristic that is to be assessed,\\n(2) define a set of questions that must be answered in order to achieve the goal, and\\n(3) identify well-formulated metrics that help to answer these questions.\\nA goal definition template [Bas94] can be used to define each measurement goal.\\nThe template takes the form:\\nAnalyze {the name of activity or attribute to be measured} for the purpose of{the over-\\nall objective of the analysis2} with respect to {the aspect of the activity or attribute that\\nis considered} from the viewpoint of{the people who have an interest in the measure-\\nment} in the context of {the environment in which the measurement takes place}.\\nAs an example, consider a goal definition template for SafeHome:\\nAnalyze the SafeHome software architecture for the purpose of evaluating architec-\\ntural components with respect to the ability to make SafeHome more extensible from\\nthe viewpoint of the software engineers performing the work in the context of prod-\\nuct enhancement over the next three years.\\nWith a measurement goal explicitly defined, a set of questions is developed. Answers\\nto these questions help the software team (or other stakeholders) to determine\\nwhether the measurement goal has been achieved.

Some demand measurement that is too\\ncomplex, others are so esoteric that few real-world professionals have any hope\\nof understanding them, and others violate the basic intuitive notions of what high-\\nquality software really is.\\nEjiogu [Eji91] defines a set of attributes that should be encompassed by effective\\nsoftware metrics. The derived metric and the measures that lead to it should be:\\n• Simple and computable. It should be relatively easy to learn how to derive the\\nmetric, and its computation should not demand inordinate effort or time.\\n• Empirically and intuitively persuasive. The metric should satisfy the engineer’s\\nintuitive notions about the product attribute under consideration (e.g., a\\nmetric that measures module cohesion should increase in value as the level\\nof cohesion increases).\\n• Consistent and objective. The metric should always yield results that are\\nunambiguous. An independent third party should be able to derive the same\\nmetric value using the same information about the software. \\n• Consistent in its use of units and dimensions. The mathematical computation\\nof the metric should use measures that do not lead to bizarre combinations\\nof units. For example, multiplying people on the project teams by program-\\nming language variables in the program results in a suspicious mix of units\\nthat are not intuitively persuasive.\\n• Programming language independent. Metrics should be based on the require-\\nments model, the design model, or the structure of the program itself. They\\nshould not be dependent on the vagaries of programming language syntax or\\nsemantics.\\n• An effective mechanism for high-quality feedback. That is, the metric should\\nprovide you with information that can lead to a higher-quality end product.\\nAlthough most software metrics satisfy these attributes, some commonly used met-\\nrics may fail to satisfy one or two of them. An example is the function point (discussed\\nin Section 23.2.1)—a measure of the “functionality” delivered by the software. It can\\nbe argued\\n3 that the consistent and objective attribute fails because an independent\\nthird party may not be able to derive the same function point value as a colleague\\n618 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nHow should\\nwe assess\\nthe quality of a\\nproposed\\nsoftware metric?\\n?\\nExperience indicates\\nthat a product metric\\nwill be used only if it is\\nintuitive and easy to\\ncompute.

It is at this stage that requirements are derived and a foundation for design is\\nestablished. Therefore, product metrics that provide insight into the quality of the\\nanalysis model are desirable.\\nAlthough relatively few analysis and specification metrics have appeared in the\\nliterature, it is possible to adapt metrics that are often used for project estimation and\\napply them in this context. These metrics examine the requirements model with the\\nintent of predicting the “size” of the resultant system. Size is sometimes (but not\\nalways) an indicator of design complexity and is almost always an indicator of\\nincreased coding, integration, and testing effort.\\npre75977_ch23.qxd  11/27/08  6:22 PM  Page 619'),\n",

Information domain values are defined in the following manner:\\n5\\nNumber of external inputs (EIs). Each external input originates from a\\nuser or is transmitted from another application and provides distinct\\napplication-oriented data or control information. Inputs are often used to\\nupdate internal logical files (ILFs). Inputs should be distinguished from\\ninquiries, which are counted separately.\\nNumber of external outputs (EOs). Each external output is derived data\\nwithin the application that provides information to the user. In this context\\nexternal output refers to reports, screens, error messages, etc. Individual data\\nitems within a report are not counted separately.\\nNumber of external inquiries (EQs). An external inquiry is defined as\\nan online input that results in the generation of some immediate software\\nresponse in the form of an online output (often retrieved from an ILF).\\nNumber of internal logical files (ILFs). Each internal logical file is a logi-\\ncal grouping of data that resides within the application’s boundary and is\\nmaintained via external inputs.\\nNumber of external interface files (EIFs). Each external interface file is a\\nlogical grouping of data that resides external to the application but provides\\ninformation that may be of use to the application.\\nOnce these data have been collected, the table in Figure 23.1 is completed and a com-\\nplexity value is associated with each count.

In addition, the authors note that high-quality\\nspecifications are electronically stored; executable or at least interpretable; annotated\\nby relative importance; and stable, versioned, organized, cross-referenced, and spec-\\nified at the right level of detail.\\nAlthough many of these characteristics appear to be qualitative in nature, Davis\\net al. [Dav93] suggest that each can be represented using one or more metrics. For\\nexample, we assume that there are n\\nr requirements in a specification, such that\\nnr /H11005nf /H11001nnf\\nwhere nf is the number of functional requirements and n nf is the number of non-\\nfunctional (e.g., performance) requirements.\\nTo determine the specificity (lack of ambiguity) of requirements, Davis et al. sug-\\ngest a metric that is based on the consistency of the reviewers’ interpretation of each\\nrequirement:\\nQ\\n1 /H11005\\nwhere nui is the number of requirements for which all reviewers had identical\\ninterpretations. The closer the value of Q to 1, the lower is the ambiguity of the\\nspecification.\\nThe completeness of functional requirements can be determined by computing the\\nratio\\nQ2 /H11005\\nwhere nu is the number of unique functional requirements, ni is the number of inputs\\n(stimuli) defined or implied by the specification, and n s is the number of states\\nnu\\nni /H11003ns\\nnui\\nnr\\nCHAPTER 23 PRODUCT METRICS 623\\nuote:\\n“Rather than just\\nmusing on what\\n’new metric’ might\\napply . . . we\\nshould also be\\nasking ourselves\\nthe more basic\\nquestion, ’What\\nwill we do with\\nmetrics?”\\nMichael Mah\\nand\\nLarry Putnam\\nBy measuring\\ncharacteristics of the\\nspecification, it is\\npossible to gain\\nquantitative insight\\ninto specificity and\\ncompleteness.\\npre75977_ch23.qxd  11/27/08  6:22 PM  Page 623'),\n",

And yet, the design of complex software-\\nbased systems often proceeds with virtually no measurement. The irony of this is that\\ndesign metrics for software are available, but the vast majority of software engineers\\ncontinue to be unaware of their existence.\\nDesign metrics for computer software, like all other software metrics, are not per-\\nfect. Debate continues over their efficacy and the manner in which they should be\\napplied. Many experts argue that further experimentation is required before design\\nmeasures can be used. And yet, design without measurement is an unacceptable\\nalternative.\\nIn the sections that follow, I examine some of the more common design metrics\\nfor computer software. Each can provide you with improved insight, and all can help\\nthe design to evolve to a higher level of quality. \\n23.3.1 Architectural Design Metrics\\nArchitectural design metrics focus on characteristics of the program architecture\\n(Chapter 9) with an emphasis on the architectural structure and the effectiveness of\\nmodules or components within the architecture. These metrics are “black box” in the\\nsense that they do not require any knowledge of the inner workings of a particular\\nsoftware component.\\nCard and Glass [Car90] define three software design complexity measures: struc-\\ntural complexity, data complexity, and system complexity.\\nFor hierarchical architectures (e.g., call-and-return architectures), structural\\ncomplexity of a module i is defined in the following manner:\\nS(i) /H11005f\\n2\\nout(i)\\nwhere fout(i) is the fan-out6 of module i.\\nnc\\nnc + nnv\\n624 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nuote:\\n“Measure what is\\nmeasurable, and\\nwhat is not\\nmeasurable, make\\nmeasurable.”\\nGalileo\\nMetrics can provide\\ninsight into structural\\ndata and system\\ncomplexity associated\\nwith architectural\\ndesign.\\n6 Fan-out is defined as the number of modules immediately subordinate to module i; that is, the\\nnumber of modules that are directly invoked by module i.\\npre75977_ch23.qxd  11/27/08  6:22 PM  Page 624'),\n",

But, as an OO design model grows in size and com-\\nplexity, a more objective view of the characteristics of the design can benefit both the\\nexperienced designer (who gains additional insight) and the novice (who obtains an\\nindication of quality that would otherwise be unavailable).\\nIn a detailed treatment of software metrics for OO systems, Whitmire [Whi97]\\ndescribes nine distinct and measurable characteristics of an OO design:\\nSize. Size is defined in terms of four views: population, volume, length, and\\nfunctionality. Population is measured by taking a static count of OO entities\\nsuch as classes or operations. Volume measures are identical to population\\nmeasures but are collected dynamically—at a given instant of time. Length is\\na measure of a chain of interconnected design elements (e.g., the depth of an\\ninheritance tree is a measure of length). Functionality metrics provide an indi-\\nrect indication of the value delivered to the customer by an OO application.\\nComplexity. Like size, there are many differing views of software complex-\\nity [Zus97]. Whitmire views complexity in terms of structural characteristics\\nby examining how classes of an OO design are interrelated to one another.\\nCoupling. The physical connections between elements of the OO design\\n(e.g., the number of collaborations between classes or the number of mes-\\nsages passed between objects) represent coupling within an OO system.\\nSufficiency. Whitmire defines sufficiency as “the degree to which an abstrac-\\ntion possesses the features required of it, or the degree to which a design\\ncomponent possesses features in its abstraction, from the point of view of\\nthe current application.” Stated another way, we ask: “What properties does\\nthis abstraction (class) need to possess to be useful to me?” [Whi97]. In\\nessence, a design component (e.g., a class) is sufficient if it fully reflects all\\nproperties of the application domain object that it is modeling—that is, that\\nthe abstraction (class) possesses the features required of it.\\nCompleteness. The only difference between completeness and sufficiency\\nis “the feature set against which we compare the abstraction or design com-\\nponent” [Whi97].

Therefore, measures and metrics\\nfor an individual class, the class hierarchy, and class collaborations will be invalu-\\nable when you are required to assess OO design quality. A class encapsulates data\\nand the function that manipulate the data. It is often the “parent” for subclasses\\n(sometimes called children) that inherit its attributes and operations. It often collab-\\norates with other classes. Each of these characteristics can be used as the basis for\\nmeasurement.\\n7\\nChidamber and Kemerer have proposed one of the most widely referenced sets of\\nOO software metrics [Chi94]. Often referred to as the CK metrics suite, the authors\\nhave proposed six class-based design metrics for OO systems.8\\nWeighted methods per class (WMC).

Those who champion measurement theory demand a degree of\\nformalism that some OO metrics do not provide.

The number of methods and their complexity are reasonable indicators\\nof the amount of effort required to implement and test a class. In addition, the larger\\nthe number of methods, the more complex is the inheritance tree (all subclasses\\ninherit the methods of their parents). Finally, as the number of methods grows for a\\ngiven class, it is likely to become more and more application specific, thereby limiting\\npotential reuse. For all of these reasons, WMC should be kept as low as is reasonable.\\nAlthough it would seem relatively straightforward to develop a count for the num-\\nber of methods in a class, the problem is actually more complex than it seems. A con-\\nsistent counting approach [Chu95] should be developed.\\nDepth of the inheritance tree (DIT). This metric is “the maximum length from\\nthe node to the root of the tree” [Chi94]. Referring to Figure 23.5, the value of DIT for\\nthe class hierarchy shown is 4. As DIT grows, it is likely that lower-level classes will\\ninherit many methods.

High values of CBO also complicate modifications\\nand the testing that ensues when modifications are made. In general, the CBO val-\\nues for each class should be kept as low as is reasonable.

Size-oriented metrics for an OO design\\nclass focus on counts of attributes and operations for an individual class and aver-\\nage values for the OO system as a whole. Inheritance-based metrics focus on the\\nmanner in which operations are reused through the class hierarchy. Metrics for\\nclass internals look at cohesion (Section 23.3.3) and code-oriented issues, and\\nexternal metrics examine coupling and reuse. One example of the metrics proposed\\nby Lorenz and Kidd is:\\nClass size (CS). The overall size of a class can be determined using the following\\nmeasures: \\n• The total number of operations (both inherited and private instance opera-\\ntions) that are encapsulated within the class\\n• The number of attributes (both inherited and private instance attributes) that\\nare encapsulated by the class\\nThe WMC metric proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer (Section 23.3.3) is also a\\nweighted measure of class size. As I noted earlier, large values for CS indicate that a\\nclass may have too much responsibility. This will reduce the reusability of the class\\nand complicate implementation and testing. In general, inherited or public opera-\\ntions and attributes should be weighted more heavily in determining class size\\n[Lor94]. Private operations and attributes enable specialization and are more local-\\nized in the design. Averages for the number of class attributes and operations may\\nalso be computed. The lower the average values for size, the more likely that classes\\nwithin the system can be reused widely.\\n23.3.6 Component-Level Design Metrics\\nComponent-level design metrics for conventional software components focus on\\ninternal characteristics of a software component and include measures of the\\n632 PART THREE QUALITY MANAGEMENT\\nDuring review of the\\nanalysis model, CRC\\nindex cards will provide\\na reasonable indication\\nof expected values for\\nCS.

Alternatively, they may be\\ndelayed until source code is available.\\nCohesion metrics. Bieman and Ott [Bie94] define a collection of metrics that\\nprovide an indication of the cohesiveness (Chapter 8) of a module. The metrics are\\ndefined in terms of five concepts and measures:\\nData slice. Stated simply, a data slice is a backward walk through a module that\\nlooks for data values that affect the module location at which the walk began. It\\nshould be noted that both program slices (which focus on statements and con-\\nditions) and data slices can be defined.\\nData tokens.

The relative stickiness of a glue token is directly proportional to the\\nnumber of data slices that it binds.\\nBieman and Ott develop metrics for strong functional cohesion(SFC), weak functional\\ncohesion (WFC), and adhesiveness(the relative degree to which glue tokens bind data\\nslices together). A detailed discussion of the Bieman and Ott metrics is best left to\\nthe authors [Bie94].\\nCoupling metrics.

A graph (Chapter 18) is a representation composed of nodes and links (also\\ncalled edges). When the links (edges) are directed, the flow graph is a directed\\ngraph.\\nMcCabe and Watson [McC94] identify a number of important uses for complexity\\nmetrics: \\nComplexity metrics can be used to predict critical information about reliability and main-\\ntainability of software systems from automatic analysis of source code [or procedural\\ndesign information]. Complexity metrics also provide feedback during the software proj-\\nect to help control the [design activity]. During testing and maintenance, they provide de-\\ntailed information about software modules to help pinpoint areas of potential instability.\\nThe most widely used (and debated) complexity metric for computer software is\\ncyclomatic complexity, originally developed by Thomas McCabe [McC76] and dis-\\ncussed in detail in Chapter 18.\\nZuse ([Zus90], [Zus97]) presents an encyclopedic discussion of no fewer than 18\\ndifferent categories of software complexity metrics.

Three simple metrics, proposed\\nby Lorenz and Kidd [Lor94], are appropriate:\\nAverage operation size (OS\\navg). Size can be determined by counting the\\nnumber of lines of code or the number of messages sent by the operation.

A typical GUI uses layout entities—graphic\\nicons, text, menus, windows, and the like—to assist the user in completing tasks. To\\naccomplish a given task using a GUI, the user must move from one layout entity to\\nthe next. The absolute and relative position of each layout entity, the frequency with\\nwhich it is used, and the “cost” of the transition from one layout entity to the next all\\ncontribute to the appropriateness of the interface.\\nA study of Web page metrics [Ivo01] indicates that simple characteristics of the\\nelements of the layout can also have a significant impact on the perceived quality of\\nthe GUI design. The number of words, links, graphics, colors, and fonts (among other\\ncharacteristics) contained within a Web page affect the perceived complexity and\\nquality of that page.\\nIt is important to note that the selection of a GUI design can be guided with met-\\nrics such as LA, but the final arbiter should be user input based on GUI prototypes.\\nNielsen and Levy [Nie94] report that “one has a reasonably large chance of suc-\\ncess if one chooses between interface [designs] based solely on users’ opinions.\\nUsers’ average task performance and their subjective satisfaction with a GUI are\\nhighly correlated.”\\nCHAPTER 23 PRODUCT METRICS 635\\nuote:\\n“You can learn at\\nleast one principle\\nof user interface\\ndesign by loading a\\ndishwasher.

In general, testers must rely on analysis, design,\\nand code metrics to guide them in the design and execution of test cases.\\nArchitectural design metrics provide information on the ease or difficulty associ-\\nated with integration testing (Section 23.3) and the need for specialized testing\\nsoftware (e.g., stubs and drivers). Cyclomatic complexity (a component-level design\\nmetric) lies at the core of basis path testing, a test-case design method presented in\\nChapter 18. In addition, cyclomatic complexity can be used to target modules as can-\\ndidates for extensive unit testing. Modules with high cyclomatic complexity are more\\nlikely to be error prone than modules whose cyclomatic complexity is lower. For this\\nreason, you should expend above average effort to uncover errors in such modules\\nbefore they are integrated in a system.\\n23.6.1 Halstead Metrics Applied to Testing\\nTesting effort can be estimated using metrics derived from Halstead measures (Sec-\\ntion 23.5).

Public attributes are inherited from\\nother classes and therefore are visible to those classes. Protected attributes\\nare accessible to methods in subclasses. This metric indicates the percentage\\nof class attributes that are public or protected. High values for PAP increase\\nthe likelihood of side effects among classes because public and protected\\nattributes lead to high potential for coupling.\\n16 Tests must be designed to\\nensure that such side effects are uncovered.\\nPublic access to data members (PAD).This metric indicates the number\\nof classes (or methods) that can access another class’s attributes, a violation of\\nencapsulation. High values for PAD lead to the potential for side effects among\\nclasses. Tests must be designed to ensure that such side effects are uncovered.\\nNumber of root classes (NOR). This metric is a count of the distinct class\\nhierarchies that are described in the design model. Test suites for each root\\nclass and the corresponding class hierarchy must be developed. As NOR\\nincreases, testing effort also increases.\\nFan-in (FIN). When used in the OO context, fan-in in the inheritance hierar-\\nchy is an indication of multiple inheritance.

Although many of\\nus (in our darker moments) take\\nDilbert’s view of “management,” it\\nremains a very necessary activity\\nwhen computer-based systems and products are\\nbuilt.

Everyone “manages” to some extent,\\nbut the scope of management activities varies\\namong people involved in a software project. A\\nsoftware engineer manages her day-to-day\\nactivities, planning, monitoring, and controlling\\ntechnical tasks. Project managers plan, monitor,\\nand control the work of a team of software engi-\\nneers. Senior managers coordinate the interface\\nbetween the business and software professionals.\\nWhy is it important? Building computer software\\nis a complex undertaking, particularly if it in-\\nvolves many people working over a relatively\\nlong time. That’s why software projects need to\\nbe managed.\\nWhat are the steps? Understand the four P’s—\\npeople, product, process, and project.

The order is not arbitrary. The manager who forgets that soft-\\nware engineering work is an intensely human endeavor will never have success in\\nproject management. A manager who fails to encourage comprehensive stake-\\nholder communication early in the evolution of a product risks building an elegant\\nsolution for the wrong problem. The manager who pays little attention to the\\nprocess runs the risk of inserting competent technical methods and tools into a\\nvacuum. The manager who embarks without a solid project plan jeopardizes the\\nsuccess of the project.\\n24.1.1 The People\\nThe cultivation of motivated, highly skilled software people has been discussed since\\nthe 1960s. In fact, the “people factor” is so important that the Software Engineering\\nInstitute has developed a People Capability Maturity Model(People-CMM), in recogni-\\ntion of the fact that “every organization needs to continually improve its ability to\\nattract, develop, motivate, organize, and retain the workforce needed to accomplish\\nits strategic business objectives” [Cur01].\\nThe people capability maturity model defines the following key practice areas\\nfor software people: staffing, communication and coordination, work environment,\\nperformance management, training, compensation, competency analysis and\\ndevelopment, career development, workgroup development, team/culture develop-\\nment, and others. Organizations that achieve high levels of People-CMM maturity\\nhave a higher likelihood of implementing effective software project management\\npractices.\\nThe People-CMM is a companion to the Software Capability Maturity Model–\\nIntegration (Chapter 30) that guides organizations in the creation of a mature\\nCHAPTER 24 PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS 647\\nproject  . . . . . . .660\\nsoftware\\nscope  . . . . . . . .656\\nsoftware\\nteam  . . . . . . . .651\\nstakeholders  . .649\\nteam leaders  . .650\\nW\\n5HH\\nprinciple  . . . . . .661\\npre75977_ch24.qxd  11/27/08  6:23 PM  Page 647'),\n",

Issues associated with people management and structure for soft-\\nware projects are considered later in this chapter.\\n24.1.2 The Product\\nBefore a project can be planned, product objectives and scope should be established,\\nalternative solutions should be considered, and technical and management con-\\nstraints should be identified. Without this information, it is impossible to define rea-\\nsonable (and accurate) estimates of the cost, an effective assessment of risk, a\\nrealistic breakdown of project tasks, or a manageable project schedule that provides\\na meaningful indication of progress.\\nAs a software developer, you and other stakeholders must meet to define product\\nobjectives and scope. In many cases, this activity begins as part of the system engi-\\nneering or business process engineering and continues as the first step in software\\nrequirements engineering (Chapter 5). Objectives identify the overall goals for the\\nproduct (from the stakeholders’ points of view) without considering how these goals\\nwill be achieved. Scope identifies the primary data, functions, and behaviors that\\ncharacterize the product, and more important, attempts to bound these characteris-\\ntics in a quantitative manner.\\nOnce the product objectives and scope are understood, alternative solutions are\\nconsidered. Although very little detail is discussed, the alternatives enable managers\\nand practitioners to select a “best” approach, given the constraints imposed by de-\\nlivery deadlines, budgetary restrictions, personnel availability, technical interfaces,\\nand myriad other factors.\\n24.1.3 The Process\\nA software process (Chapters 2 and 3) provides the framework from which a com-\\nprehensive plan for software development can be established. A small number of\\nframework activities are applicable to all software projects, regardless of their size\\nor complexity. A number of different task sets—tasks, milestones, work products,\\nand quality assurance points—enable the framework activities to be adapted to\\nthe characteristics of the software project and the requirements of the project\\nteam. Finally, umbrella activities—such as software quality assurance, software\\nconfiguration management, and measurement—overlay the process model. Um-\\nbrella activities are independent of any one framework activity and occur\\nthroughout the process.\\n24.1.4 The Project\\nWe conduct planned and controlled software projects for one primary reason—it is\\nthe only known way to manage complexity. And yet, software teams still struggle.\\nIn a study of 250 large software projects between 1998 and 2004, Capers Jones\\n[Jon04] found that “about 25 were deemed successful in that they achieved their\\nschedule, cost, and quality objectives.

Each of\\nthese issues is discussed in Section 24.5 and in the chapters that follow.\\n24.2 P EOPLE\\nIn a study published by the IEEE [Cur88], the engineering vice presidents of three\\nmajor technology companies were asked what was the most important contributor\\nto a successful software project. They answered in the following way:\\nVP 1: I guess if you had to pick one thing out that is most important in our\\nenvironment, I’d say it’s not the tools that we use, it’s the people.\\nVP 2: The most important ingredient that was successful on this project was\\nhaving smart people . . . very little else matters in my opinion. . . . The most\\nimportant thing you do for a project is selecting the staff. . . . The success of\\nthe software development organization is very, very much associated with the\\nability to recruit good people.\\nVP 3: The only rule I have in management is to ensure I have good people—real\\ngood people—and that I grow good people—and that I provide an environment\\nin which good people can produce.\\nIndeed, this is a compelling testimonial on the importance of people in the software\\nengineering process. And yet, all of us, from senior engineering vice presidents to the\\nlowliest practitioner, often take people for granted. Managers argue (as the preced-\\ning group had) that people are primary, but their actions sometimes belie their words.\\nIn this section I examine the stakeholders who participate in the software process and\\nthe manner in which they are organized to perform effective software engineering.\\n24.2.1 The Stakeholders\\nThe software process (and every software project) is populated by stakeholders who\\ncan be categorized into one of five constituencies:\\n1. Senior managers who define the business issues that often have a significant\\ninfluence on the project.\\nCHAPTER 24 PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS 649\\n1 Given these statistics, it’s reasonable to ask how the impact of computers continues to grow expo-\\nnentially. Part of the answer, I think, is that a substantial number of these “failed” projects are ill\\nconceived in the first place.

And that’s the job of the team leader.\\n24.2.2 Team Leaders\\nProject management is a people-intensive activity, and for this reason, competent\\npractitioners often make poor team leaders. They simply don’t have the right mix of\\npeople skills. And yet, as Edgemon states: “Unfortunately and all too frequently it\\nseems, individuals just fall into a project manager role and become accidental proj-\\nect managers” [Edg95].\\nIn an excellent book of technical leadership, Jerry Weinberg [Wei86] suggests an\\nMOI model of leadership:\\nMotivation. The ability to encourage (by “push or pull”) technical people to\\nproduce to their best ability.\\nOrganization. The ability to mold existing processes (or invent new ones)\\nthat will enable the initial concept to be translated into a final product.\\nIdeas or innovation. The ability to encourage people to create and feel\\ncreative even when they must work within bounds established for a particu-\\nlar software product or application.\\nWeinberg suggests that successful project leaders apply a problem-solving manage-\\nment style. That is, a software project manager should concentrate on understand-\\ning the problem to be solved, managing the flow of ideas, and at the same time,\\nletting everyone on the team know (by words and, far more important, by actions)\\nthat quality counts and that it will not be compromised.\\nAnother view [Edg95] of the characteristics that define an effective project man-\\nager emphasizes four key traits:\\nProblem solving. An effective software project manager can diagnose the\\ntechnical and organizational issues that are most relevant, systematically\\nstructure a solution or properly motivate other practitioners to develop the\\nsolution, apply lessons learned from past projects to new situations, and\\n650 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\n2 When WebApps are developed, other nontechnical people may be involved in content creation.\\nWhat do we\\nlook for\\nwhen choosing\\nsomeone to lead a\\nsoftware project?\\n?\\nuote:\\n“In simplest terms,\\na leader is one who\\nknows where he\\nwants to go, and\\ngets up, and goes.”\\nJohn Erskine\\npre75977_ch24.qxd  11/27/08  6:23 PM  Page 650'),\n",

For better or worse, organi-\\nzational structure cannot be easily modified. Concern with the practical and political\\nconsequences of organizational change are not within the software project man-\\nager’s scope of responsibility. However, the organization of the people directly in-\\nvolved in a new software project is within the project manager’s purview.\\nThe “best” team structure depends on the management style of your organization,\\nthe number of people who will populate the team and their skill levels, and the over-\\nall problem difficulty. Mantei [Man81] describes seven project factors that should be\\nconsidered when planning the structure of software engineering teams:\\n• Difficulty of the problem to be solved\\n• “Size” of the resultant program(s) in lines of code or function points\\n• Time that the team will stay together (team lifetime)\\n• Degree to which the problem can be modularized\\n• Required quality and reliability of the system to be built\\n• Rigidity of the delivery date\\n• Degree of sociability (communication) required for the project\\nConstantine [Con93] suggests four “organizational paradigms” for software\\nengineering teams:\\n1. A closed paradigm structures a team along a traditional hierarchy of authority.\\nSuch teams can work well when producing software that is quite similar to\\npast efforts, but they will be less likely to be innovative when working within\\nthe closed paradigm.\\nCHAPTER 24 PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS 651\\nuote:\\n“Not every group\\nis a team, and not\\nevery team is\\neffective.”\\nGlenn Parker\\nWhat factors\\nshould be\\nconsidered when\\nthe structure of a\\nsoftware team is\\nchosen?\\n?\\nWhat\\noptions do\\nwe have when\\ndefining the\\nstructure of a\\nsoftware team?\\n?\\npre75977_ch24.qxd  11/27/08  6:23 PM  Page 651'),\n",

A random paradigm structures a team loosely and depends on individual ini-\\ntiative of the team members. When innovation or technological breakthrough\\nis required, teams following the random paradigm will excel. But such teams\\nmay struggle when “orderly performance” is required.\\n3. An open paradigm attempts to structure a team in a manner that achieves\\nsome of the controls associated with the closed paradigm but also much\\nof the innovation that occurs when using the random paradigm. Work is\\nperformed collaboratively, with heavy communication and consensus-based\\ndecision making the trademarks of open paradigm teams. Open paradigm\\nteam structures are well suited to the solution of complex problems but may\\nnot perform as efficiently as other teams.\\n4. A synchronous paradigm relies on the natural compartmentalization of a\\nproblem and organizes team members to work on pieces of the problem with\\nlittle active communication among themselves.\\nAs an historical footnote, one of the earliest software team organizations was a\\nclosed paradigm structure originally called the chief programmer team. This struc-\\nture was first proposed by Harlan Mills and described by Baker [Bak72]. The nu-\\ncleus of the team was composed of a senior engineer (the chief programmer), who\\nplans, coordinates, and reviews all technical activities of the team; technical staff\\n(normally two to five people), who conduct analysis and development activities;\\nand a backup engineer, who supports the senior engineer in his or her activities and\\ncan replace the senior engineer with minimum loss in project continuity. The chief\\nprogrammer may be served by one or more specialists (e.g., telecommunications\\nexpert, database designer), support staff (e.g., technical writers, clerical personnel),\\nand a software librarian.\\nAs a counterpoint to the chief programmer team structure, Constantine’s random\\nparadigm [Con93] suggests a software team with creative independence whose\\napproach to work might best be termed innovative anarchy.Although the free-spirited\\napproach to software work has appeal, channeling creative energy into a high-\\nperformance team must be a central goal of a software engineering organization.\\nTo achieve a high-performance team:\\n• Team members must have trust in one another.\\n• The distribution of skills must be appropriate to the problem.\\n• Mavericks may have to be excluded from the team, if team cohesiveness is to\\nbe maintained.\\nRegardless of team organization, the objective for every project manager is to\\nhelp create a team that exhibits cohesiveness. In their book, Peopleware, DeMarco\\nand Lister [DeM98] discuss this issue: \\nWe tend to use the word team fairly loosely in the business world, calling any group of\\npeople assigned to work together a “team.” But many of these groups just don’t seem like\\n652 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\nuote:\\n“If you want to be\\nincrementally\\nbetter: Be\\ncompetitive.

They don’t have a common definition of success or any identifiable team spirit.\\nWhat is missing is a phenomenon that we call jell.\\nA jelled team is a group of people so strongly knit that the whole is greater than the\\nsum of the parts. . . .\\nOnce a team begins to jell, the probability of success goes way up. The team can\\nbecome unstoppable, a juggernaut for success. . . . They don’t need to be managed in the\\ntraditional way, and they certainly don’t need to be motivated. They’ve got momentum.\\nDeMarco and Lister contend that members of jelled teams are significantly more pro-\\nductive and more motivated than average. They share a common goal, a common\\nculture, and in many cases, a “sense of eliteness” that makes them unique.\\nBut not all teams jell. In fact, many teams suffer from what Jackman [Jac98] calls\\n“team toxicity.” She defines five factors that “foster a potentially toxic team environ-\\nment”: (1) a frenzied work atmosphere, (2) high frustration that causes friction\\namong team members, (3) a “fragmented or poorly coordinated” software process,\\n(4) an unclear definition of roles on the software team, and (5) “continuous and re-\\npeated exposure to failure.”\\nTo avoid a frenzied work environment, the project manager should be certain that\\nthe team has access to all information required to do the job and that major goals and\\nobjectives, once defined, should not be modified unless absolutely necessary. A soft-\\nware team can avoid frustration if it is given as much responsibility for decision mak-\\ning as possible. An inappropriate process (e.g., unnecessary or burdensome work\\ntasks or poorly chosen work products) can be avoided by understanding the product\\nto be built, the people doing the work, and by allowing the team to select the process\\nmodel. The team itself should establish its own mechanisms for accountability (tech-\\nnical reviews\\n3 are an excellent way to accomplish this) and define a series of correc-\\ntive approaches when a member of the team fails to perform. And finally, the key to\\navoiding an atmosphere of failure is to establish team-based techniques for feedback\\nand problem solving.\\nIn addition to the five toxins described by Jackman, a software team often strug-\\ngles with the differing human traits of its members. Some team members are extro-\\nverts; others are introverts. Some people gather information intuitively, distilling\\nbroad concepts from disparate facts. Others process information linearly, collecting\\nand organizing minute details from the data provided. Some team members are\\ncomfortable making decisions only when a logical, orderly argument is presented.\\nOthers are intuitive, willing to make a decision based on “feel.” Some practitioners\\nwant a detailed schedule populated by organized tasks that enable them to achieve\\nclosure for some element of a project.

To\\nreview, the agile philosophy encourages customer satisfaction and early incremen-\\ntal delivery of software, small highly motivated project teams, informal methods,\\nminimal software engineering work products, and overall development simplicity.\\nThe small, highly motivated project team, also called an agile team, adopts many\\nof the characteristics of successful software project teams discussed in the preced-\\ning section and avoids many of the toxins that create problems. However, the agile\\nphilosophy stresses individual (team member) competency coupled with group col-\\nlaboration as critical success factors for the team. Cockburn and Highsmith [Coc01a]\\nnote this when they write:\\nIf the people on the project are good enough, they can use almost any process and\\naccomplish their assignment. If they are not good enough, no process will repair their\\ninadequacy—“people trump process” is one way to say this. However, lack of user and\\nexecutive support can kill a project—“politics trump people.” Inadequate support can\\nkeep even good people from accomplishing the job.\\nTo make effective use of the competencies of each team member and to foster\\neffective collaboration through a software project, agile teams are self-organizing.\\nA self-organizing team does not necessarily maintain a single team structure but\\ninstead uses elements of Constantine’s random, open, and synchronous paradigms\\ndiscussed in Section 24.2.3.\\nMany agile process models (e.g., Scrum) give the agile team significant autonomy\\nto make the project management and technical decisions required to get the job\\ndone. Planning is kept to a minimum, and the team is allowed to select its own\\napproach (e.g., process, methods, tools), constrained only by business requirements\\nand organizational standards. As the project proceeds, the team self-organizes to\\nfocus individual competency in a way that is most beneficial to the project at a given\\npoint in time. To accomplish this, an agile team might conduct daily team meetings\\nto coordinate and synchronize the work that must be accomplished for that day.\\nBased on information obtained during these meetings, the team adapts its approach\\nin a way that accomplishes an increment of work. As each day passes, continual self-\\norganization and collaboration move the team toward a completed software increment.\\n654 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\n4 An excellent introduction to these issues as they relate to software project teams can be found in\\n[Fer98].\\nAn agile team is a self-\\norganizing team that\\nhas autonomy to plan\\nand make technical\\ndecisions.\\npre75977_ch24.qxd  11/27/08  6:23 PM  Page 654'),\n",

To accomplish this, mechanisms for\\nformal and informal communication among team members and between multiple\\nteams must be established. Formal communication is accomplished through “writ-\\ning, structured meetings, and other relatively non-interactive and impersonal com-\\nmunication channels” [Kra95].

Quantitative estimates and an organized plan are required, but\\nsolid information is unavailable. A detailed analysis of software requirements would\\nprovide necessary information for estimates, but analysis often takes weeks or even\\nmonths to complete. Worse, requirements may be fluid, changing regularly as the\\nproject proceeds. Yet, a plan is needed “now!”\\nLike it or not, you must examine the product and the problem it is intended to\\nsolve at the very beginning of the project. At a minimum, the scope of the product\\nmust be established and bounded.\\n24.3.1 Software Scope\\nThe first software project management activity is the determination of software\\nscope. Scope is defined by answering the following questions:\\nContext. How does the software to be built fit into a larger system, product, or\\nbusiness context, and what constraints are imposed as a result of the context?\\nInformation objectives. What customer-visible data objects are produced\\nas output from the software? What data objects are required for input?\\nFunction and performance. What function does the software perform to\\ntransform input data into output? Are any special performance characteris-\\ntics to be addressed?\\nSoftware project scope must be unambiguous and understandable at the manage-\\nment and technical levels. A statement of software scope must be bounded. That is,\\nquantitative data (e.g., number of simultaneous users, target environment, maxi-\\nmum allowable response time) are stated explicitly, constraints and/or limitations\\n(e.g., product cost restricts memory size) are noted, and mitigating factors (e.g.,\\ndesired algorithms are well understood and available in Java) are described.\\n24.3.2 Problem Decomposition\\nProblem decomposition, sometimes called partitioning or problem elaboration, is an\\nactivity that sits at the core of software requirements analysis (Chapters 6 and 7).\\nDuring the scoping activity no attempt is made to fully decompose the problem.\\nRather, decomposition is applied in two major areas: (1) the functionality and\\ncontent (information) that must be delivered and (2) the process that will be used to\\ndeliver it.\\nHuman beings tend to apply a divide-and-conquer strategy when they are con-\\nfronted with a complex problem. Stated simply, a complex problem is partitioned\\ninto smaller problems that are more manageable. This is the strategy that applies as\\nproject planning begins. Software functions, described in the statement of scope, are\\nevaluated and refined to provide more detail prior to the beginning of estimation\\n(Chapter 26). Because both cost and schedule estimates are functionally oriented,\\n656 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\nIf you can’t bound a\\ncharacteristic of the\\nsoftware you intend to\\nbuild, list the charac-\\nteristic as a project risk\\n(Chapter 25).\\nIn order to develop a\\nreasonable project\\nplan, you must\\ndecompose the\\nproblem.

Similarly, major content or data\\nobjects are decomposed into their constituent parts, providing a reasonable under-\\nstanding of the information to be produced by the software.\\nAs an example, consider a project that will build a new word-processing product.\\nAmong the unique features of the product are continuous voice as well as virtual\\nkeyboard input via a multitouch screen, extremely sophisticated “automatic copy\\nedit” features, page layout capability, automatic indexing and table of contents, and\\nothers. The project manager must first establish a statement of scope that bounds\\nthese features (as well as other more mundane functions such as editing, file man-\\nagement, and document production). For example, will continuous voice input re-\\nquire that the product be “trained” by the user? Specifically, what capabilities will the\\ncopy edit feature provide? Just how sophisticated will the page layout capability be\\nand will it encompass the capabilities implied by a multitouch screen?\\nAs the statement of scope evolves, a first level of partitioning naturally occurs.\\nThe project team learns that the marketing department has talked with potential cus-\\ntomers and found that the following functions should be part of automatic copy ed-\\niting: (1) spell checking, (2) sentence grammar checking, (3) reference checking for\\nlarge documents (e.g., Is a reference to a bibliography entry found in the list of en-\\ntries in the bibliography?), (4) the implementation of a style sheet feature that im-\\nposed consistency across a document, and (5) section and chapter reference\\nvalidation for large documents. Each of these features represents a subfunction to be\\nimplemented in software. Each can be further refined if the decomposition will make\\nplanning easier.\\n24.4 T HE PROCESS\\nThe framework activities (Chapter 2) that characterize the software process are\\napplicable to all software projects. The problem is to select the process model that is\\nappropriate for the software to be engineered by your project team.\\nYour team must decide which process model is most appropriate for (1) the cus-\\ntomers who have requested the product and the people who will do the work, (2) the\\ncharacteristics of the product itself, and (3) the project environment in which the\\nsoftware team works. When a process model has been selected, the team then\\ndefines a preliminary project plan based on the set of process framework activities.\\nOnce the preliminary plan is established, process decomposition begins. That is, a\\ncomplete plan, reflecting the work tasks required to populate the framework activi-\\nties must be created. We explore these activities briefly in the sections that follow\\nand present a more detailed view in Chapter 26.\\n24.4.1 Melding the Product and the Process\\nProject planning begins with the melding of the product and the process.

It\\nbegins before any technical activity is initiated and continues throughout the mod-\\neling, construction, and deployment of computer software.\\nFour P’s have a substantial influence on software project management—people,\\nproduct, process, and project. People must be organized into effective teams, mo-\\ntivated to do high-quality software work, and coordinated to achieve effective\\ncommunication. Product requirements must be communicated from customer to\\ndeveloper, partitioned (decomposed) into their constituent parts, and positioned\\nfor work by the software team. The process must be adapted to the people and the\\nproduct. A common process framework is selected, an appropriate software engi-\\nneering paradigm is applied, and a set of work tasks is chosen to get the job done.\\nFinally, the project must be organized in a manner that enables the software team\\nto succeed.\\nThe pivotal element in all software projects is people. Software engineers can be\\norganized in a number of different team structures that range from traditional\\ncontrol hierarchies to “open paradigm” teams. A variety of coordination and com-\\nmunication techniques can be applied to support the work of the team. In general,\\ntechnical reviews and informal person-to-person communication have the most\\nvalue for practitioners.\\nThe project management activity encompasses measurement and metrics, esti-\\nmation and scheduling, risk analysis, tracking, and control. Each of these topics is\\nconsidered in the chapters that follow.\\nPROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER\\n24.1. Based on information contained in this chapter and your own experience, develop “ten\\ncommandments” for empowering software engineers. That is, make a list of 10 guidelines that\\nwill lead to software people who work to their full potential.\\n24.2.

The skill and motivation of people has been shown [Boe81] to be the\\nsingle most influential factor in quality and performance.

That is, project metrics and the indicators derived from\\nthem are used by a project manager and a software team to adapt project workflow\\nand technical activities.\\nThe first application of project metrics on most software projects occurs during\\nestimation. Metrics collected from past projects are used as a basis from which effort\\nand time estimates are made for current software work. As a project proceeds, mea-\\nsures of effort and calendar time expended are compared to original estimates (and the\\nproject schedule). The project manager uses these data to monitor and control progress.\\nAs technical work commences, other project metrics begin to have significance.\\nProduction rates represented in terms of models created, review hours, function\\npoints, and delivered source lines are measured. In addition, errors uncovered\\nduring each software engineering task are tracked. As the software evolves from\\nrequirements into design, technical metrics (Chapter 23) are collected to assess\\ndesign quality and to provide indicators that will influence the approach taken to\\ncode generation and testing.\\nThe intent of project metrics is twofold. First, these metrics are used to minimize\\nthe development schedule by making the adjustments necessary to avoid delays and\\nmitigate potential problems and risks. Second, project metrics are used to assess pro-\\nduct quality on an ongoing basis and, when necessary, modify the technical approach\\nto improve quality.\\nAs quality improves, defects are minimized, and as the defect count goes down,\\nthe amount of rework required during the project is also reduced. This leads to a\\nreduction in overall project cost.\\n670 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\nHow should\\nwe use\\nmetrics during the\\nproject itself?\\n?\\nThe scene: Doug Miller’s office as the\\nSafeHome software project is about\\nto begin.\\nThe players: Doug Miller (manager of the SafeHome\\nsoftware engineering team) and Vinod Raman and Jamie\\nLazar, members of the product software engineering team.\\nThe conversation:\\nDoug: Before we start work on this project, I’d like you\\nguys to define and collect a set of simple metrics.

Software metrics can\\nbe categorized similarly.\\nDirect measures of the software process include cost and effort applied. Direct\\nmeasures of the product include lines of code (LOC) produced, execution speed,\\nmemory size, and defects reported over some set period of time. Indirect measures\\nof the product include functionality, quality, complexity, efficiency, reliability, main-\\ntainability, and many other “–abilities” that are discussed in Chapter 14.\\nThe cost and effort required to build software, the number of lines of code pro-\\nduced, and other direct measures are relatively easy to collect, as long as specific\\nconventions for measurement are established in advance. However, the quality and\\nfunctionality of software or its efficiency or maintainability are more difficult to as-\\nsess and can be measured only indirectly.\\nI have partitioned the software metrics domain into process, project, and product\\nmetrics and noted that product metrics that are private to an individual are often\\ncombined to develop project metrics that are public to a software team. Project met-\\nrics are then consolidated to create process metrics that are public to the software\\norganization as a whole.

Individuals on two different project\\nteams record and categorize all errors that they find during the software process. In-\\ndividual measures are then combined to develop team measures. Team A found 342\\nerrors during the software process prior to release. Team B found 184 errors.

If a soft-\\nware organization maintains simple records, a table of size-oriented measures, such\\nas the one shown in Figure 25.2, can be created. The table lists each software devel-\\nopment project that has been completed over the past few years and corresponding\\nmeasures for that project. Referring to the table entry (Figure 25.2) for project alpha:\\n12,100 lines of code were developed with 24 person-months of effort at a cost of\\n$168,000.

Three people worked on the development of software for project alpha.\\nIn order to develop metrics that can be assimilated with similar metrics from other\\nprojects, you can choose lines of code as a normalization value.

Proponents of the LOC measure claim that LOC is an “artifact” of all soft-\\nware development projects that can be easily counted, that many existing software\\nestimation models use LOC or KLOC as a key input, and that a large body of literature\\nand data predicated on LOC already exists. On the other hand, opponents argue that\\nLOC measures are programming language dependent, that when productivity is con-\\nsidered, they penalize well-designed but shorter programs; that they cannot easily\\naccommodate nonprocedural languages; and that their use in estimation requires a\\nlevel of detail that may be difficult to achieve (i.e., the planner must estimate the LOC\\nto be produced long before analysis and design have been completed).\\n25.2.2 Function-Oriented Metrics\\nFunction-oriented software metrics use a measure of the functionality delivered by\\nthe application as a normalization value. The most widely used function-oriented\\nmetric is the function point (FP). Computation of the function point is based on char-\\nacteristics of the software’s information domain and complexity. The mechanics of\\nFP computation have been discussed in Chapter 23.\\n3\\nThe function point, like the LOC measure, is controversial. Proponents claim that\\nFP is programming language independent, making it ideal for applications using con-\\nventional and nonprocedural languages, and that it is based on data that are more\\nlikely to be known early in the evolution of a project, making FP more attractive as an\\nestimation approach. Opponents claim that the method requires some “sleight of\\nhand” in that computation is based on subjective rather than objective data, that\\ncounts of the information domain (and other dimensions) can be difficult to collect\\nafter the fact, and that FP has no direct physical meaning—it’s just a number.\\n25.2.3 Reconciling LOC and FP Metrics\\nThe relationship between lines of code and function points depends upon the pro-\\ngramming language that is used to implement the software and the quality of the\\ndesign.

Measures and metrics used for traditional software\\nengineering projects are difficult to translate directly to WebApps.

Among the measures that can be\\ncollected are:\\nNumber of static Web pages. Web pages with static content (i.e., the end\\nuser has no control over the content displayed on the page) are the most\\ncommon of all WebApp features. These pages represent low relative com-\\nplexity and generally require less effort to construct than dynamic pages. This\\nmeasure provides an indication of the overall size of the application and the\\neffort required to develop it.\\nNumber of dynamic Web pages. Web pages with dynamic content (i.e.,\\nend-user actions or other external factors result in customized content dis-\\nplayed on the page) are essential in all e-commerce applications, search\\nengines, financial applications, and many other WebApp categories. These\\npages represent higher relative complexity and require more effort to con-\\nstruct than static pages. This measure provides an indication of the overall\\nsize of the application and the effort required to develop it.\\nNumber of internal page links. Internal page links are pointers that pro-\\nvide a hyperlink to some other Web page within the WebApp. This measure\\nprovides an indication of the degree of architectural coupling within the\\nWebApp. As the number of page links increases, the effort expended on\\nnavigational design and construction also increases.\\nCHAPTER 25 PROCESS AND PROJECT METRICS 677\\npre75977_ch25.qxd  11/27/08  6:25 PM  Page 677'),\n",

You can use measurement to assess the quality of the requirements and de-\\nsign models, the source code, and the test cases that have been created as the soft-\\nware is engineered. To accomplish this real-time assessment, you apply product\\nmetrics (Chapter 23) to evaluate the quality of software engineering work products\\nin objective, rather than subjective ways.\\nA project manager must also evaluate quality as the project progresses. Private\\nmetrics collected by individual software engineers are combined to provide project-\\nlevel results.

DRE is\\ndiscussed in Section 25.3.3.\\n25.3.1 Measuring Quality\\nAlthough there are many measures of software quality, 8 correctness, maintainabil-\\nity, integrity, and usability provide useful indicators for the project team. Gilb [Gil88]\\nsuggests definitions and measures for each.\\nCorrectness. A program must operate correctly or it provides little value to\\nits users. Correctness is the degree to which the software performs its re-\\nquired function. The most common measure for correctness is defects per\\nKLOC, where a defect is defined as a verified lack of conformance to require-\\nments. When considering the overall quality of a software product, defects\\nare those problems reported by a user of the program after the program has\\nbeen released for general use. For quality assessment purposes, defects are\\ncounted over a standard period of time, typically one year.\\nMaintainability. Software maintenance and support accounts for more ef-\\nfort than any other software engineering activity. Maintainability is the ease\\nwith which a program can be corrected if an error is encountered, adapted\\nif its environment changes, or enhanced if the customer desires a change in\\nrequirements. There is no way to measure maintainability directly; there-\\nfore, you must use indirect measures. A simple time-oriented metric is\\nmean-time-to-change (MTTC), the time it takes to analyze the change\\nrequest, design an appropriate modification, implement the change, test it,\\nand distribute the change to all users. On average, programs that are main-\\ntainable will have a lower MTTC (for equivalent types of changes) than\\nprograms that are not maintainable.\\nIntegrity. Software integrity has become increasingly important in the age\\nof cyber terrorists and hackers. This attribute measures a system’s ability\\nto withstand attacks (both accidental and intentional) to its security.\\nAttacks can be made on all three components of software: programs, data,\\nand documention.\\nTo measure integrity, two additional attributes must be defined: threat and\\nsecurity. Threat is the probability (which can be estimated or derived from\\nempirical evidence) that an attack of a specific type will occur within a given\\ntime. Security is the probability (which can be estimated or derived from\\n680 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\n8 A detailed discussion of the factors that influence software quality and the metrics that can be used\\nto assess software quality has been presented in Chapter 23.\\nWebRef\\nAn excellent source\\nof information on\\nsoftware quality and\\nrelated topics\\n(including metrics) can\\nbe found at www\\n.qualityworld.com.\\npre75977_ch25.qxd  11/27/08  6:25 PM  Page 680'),\n",

The\\nintegrity of a system can then be defined as:\\nIntegrity /H11005/H20858[1 /H11002(threat /H11003(1 /H11002security))]\\nFor example, if threat (the probability that an attack will occur) is 0.25 and\\nsecurity (the likelihood of repelling an attack) is 0.95, the integrity of the sys-\\ntem is 0.99 (very high). If, on the other hand, the threat probability is 0.50 and\\nthe likelihood of repelling an attack is only 0.25, the integrity of the system is\\n0.63 (unacceptably low).\\nUsability. If a program is not easy to use, it is often doomed to failure, even if\\nthe functions that it performs are valuable. Usability is an attempt to quantify\\nease of use and can be measured in terms of the characteristics presented in\\nChapter 11.\\nThe four factors just described are only a sampling of those that have been proposed\\nas measures for software quality. Chapter 23 considers this topic in additional detail.\\n25.3.2 Defect Removal Efficiency\\nA quality metric that provides benefit at both the project and process level is defect\\nremoval efficiency (DRE). In essence, DRE is a measure of the filtering ability of qual-\\nity assurance and control actions as they are applied throughout all process frame-\\nwork activities.\\nWhen considered for a project as a whole, DRE is defined in the following manner: \\nDRE /H11005\\nwhere E is the number of errors found before delivery of the software to the end user\\nand D is the number of defects found after delivery.\\nThe ideal value for DRE is 1. That is, no defects are found in the software. Realisti-\\ncally, D will be greater than 0, but the value of DRE can still approach 1 as E increases\\nfor a given value of D. In fact, as E increases, it is likely that the final value of D will\\ndecrease (errors are filtered out before they become defects). If used as a metric that\\nprovides an indicator of the filtering ability of quality control and assurance activities,\\nDRE encourages a software project team to institute techniques for finding as many\\nerrors as possible before delivery.\\nDRE can also be used within the project to assess a team’s ability to find errors\\nbefore they are passed to the next framework activity or software engineering action.\\nFor example, requirements analysis produces a requirements model that can be\\nreviewed to find and correct errors. Those errors that are not found during the review\\nof the requirements model are passed on to design (where they may or may not be\\nfound). When used in this context, we redefine DRE as \\nDRE\\ni /H11005 Ei\\nEi /H11001Ei/H110011\\nE\\nE /H11001D\\nCHAPTER 25 PROCESS AND PROJECT METRICS 681\\nIf DRE is low as you\\nmove through analysis\\nand design, spend\\nsome time improving\\nthe way you conduct\\ntechnical reviews.\\npre75977_ch25.qxd  11/27/08  6:25 PM  Page 681'),\n",

As I noted earlier in this chapter, the problem is cultural. Attempting\\nto collect measures where none have been collected in the past often precipitates\\nresistance. “Why do we need to do this?” asks a harried project manager. “I don’t see\\nthe point,” complains an overworked practitioner.\\nIn this section, I consider some arguments for software metrics and present an\\napproach for instituting a metrics collection program within a software engineering\\norganization. But before I begin, some words of wisdom (now more than two\\ndecades old) are suggested by Grady and Caswell [Gra87]:\\npre75977_ch25.qxd  11/27/08  6:25 PM  Page 682'),\n",

Realistically, though, estab-\\nlishing a successful company-wide software metrics program is hard work. When we say\\nthat you must wait at least three years before broad organizational trends are available,\\nyou get some idea of the scope of such an effort.\\nThe caveat suggested by the authors is well worth heeding, but the benefits of meas-\\nurement are so compelling that the hard work is worth it.\\n25.4.1 Arguments for Software Metrics\\nWhy is it so important to measure the process of software engineering and the prod-\\nuct (software) that it produces? The answer is relatively obvious. If you do not mea-\\nsure, there no real way of determining whether you are improving. And if you are not\\nimproving, you are lost.\\nBy requesting and evaluating productivity and quality measures, a software team\\n(and its management) can establish meaningful goals for improvement of the soft-\\nware process. Early in this book, I noted that software is a strategic business issue\\nfor many companies. If the process through which it is developed can be improved, a\\ndirect impact on the bottom line can result. But to establish goals for improvement,\\nthe current status of software development must be understood. Hence, measurement\\nis used to establish a process baseline from which improvements can be assessed.\\nThe day-to-day rigors of software project work leave little time for strategic think-\\ning. Software project managers are concerned with more mundane (but equally impor-\\ntant) issues: developing meaningful project estimates, producing higher-quality\\nsystems, getting product out the door on time. By using measurement to establish a\\nproject baseline, each of these issues becomes more manageable. I have already\\nnoted that the baseline serves as a basis for estimation. Additionally, the collection of\\nquality metrics enables an organization to “tune” its software process to remove the\\n“vital few” causes of defects that have the greatest impact on software development.\\n9\\n25.4.2 Establishing a Baseline\\nBy establishing a metrics baseline, benefits can be obtained at the process, project,\\nand product (technical) levels. Yet the information that is collected need not be fun-\\ndamentally different. The same metrics can serve many masters. The metrics base-\\nline consists of data collected from past software development projects and can be\\nas simple as the table presented in Figure 25.2 or as complex as a comprehensive\\ndatabase containing dozens of project measures and the metrics derived from them.\\nTo be an effective aid in process improvement and/or cost and effort estimation,\\nbaseline data must have the following attributes: (1) data must be reasonably\\naccurate—“guestimates” about past projects are to be avoided, (2) data should be\\ncollected for as many projects as possible, (3) measures must be consistent (for ex-\\nample, a line of code must be interpreted consistently across all projects for which\\nCHAPTER 25 PROCESS AND PROJECT METRICS 683\\nuote:\\n“We manage\\nthings by the\\nnumbers in many\\naspects of our lives\\n. . .

Ideally,\\ndata needed to establish a baseline have been collected in an ongoing manner.\\nSadly, this is rarely the case. Therefore, data collection requires an historical inves-\\ntigation of past projects to reconstruct required data. Once measures have been col-\\nlected (unquestionably the most difficult step), metrics computation is possible.\\nDepending on the breadth of measures collected, metrics can span a broad range\\nof application-oriented metrics (e.g., LOC, FP, object-oriented, WebApp) as well as\\nother quality- and project-oriented metrics. Finally, metrics must be evaluated and\\napplied during estimation, technical work, project control, and process improve-\\nment. Metrics evaluation focuses on the underlying reasons for the results obtained\\nand produces a set of indicators that guide the project or process.\\n25.5 M ETRICS FOR SMALL ORGANIZATIONS\\nThe vast majority of software development organizations have fewer than 20 soft-\\nware people. It is unreasonable, and in most cases unrealistic, to expect that such\\norganizations will develop comprehensive software metrics programs. However, it\\nis reasonable to suggest that software organizations of all sizes measure and then\\nuse the resultant metrics to help improve their local software process and the qual-\\nity and timeliness of the products they produce.\\nA commonsense approach to the implementation of any software process-related\\nactivity is: keep it simple, customize to meet local needs, and be sure it adds value.\\n684 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\nSoftware\\nengineering\\nprocess\\nSoftware\\nproject\\nSoftware\\nproduct\\nData\\ncollection\\nMetrics\\ncomputation\\nMetrics\\nevaluation\\nMeasures\\nMetrics\\nIndicators\\nFIGURE 25.3\\nSoftware\\nmetrics collec-\\ntion process\\nIf you’re just starting to\\ncollect metrics data,\\nremember to keep it\\nsimple.

You can begin by focusing not on measurement but rather on results.\\nThe software group is polled to define a single objective that requires improvement. For\\nexample, “reduce the time to evaluate and implement change requests.” A small\\norganization might select the following set of easily collected measures:\\n• Time (hours or days) elapsed from the time a request is made until evaluation\\nis complete, t\\nqueue.\\n• Effort (person-hours) to perform the evaluation, Weval.\\n• Time (hours or days) elapsed from completion of evaluation to assignment of\\nchange order to personnel, t\\neval.\\n• Effort (person-hours) required to make the change, Wchange.\\n• Time required (hours or days) to make the change, tchange.\\n• Errors uncovered during work to make change, Echange.\\n• Defects uncovered after change is released to the customer base, Dchange.\\nOnce these measures have been collected for a number of change requests, it is\\npossible to compute the total elapsed time from change request to implementation\\nof the change and the percentage of elapsed time absorbed by initial queuing, eval-\\nuation and change assignment, and change implementation. Similarly, the percent-\\nage of effort required for evaluation and implementation can be determined. These\\nmetrics can be assessed in the context of quality data, E\\nchange and Dchange.

However, a\\nbrief overview of key points is worthwhile.\\nBecause software supports business functions, differentiates computer-based\\nsystems or products, or acts as a product in itself, goals defined for the business can\\nalmost always be traced downward to specific goals at the software engineering\\nlevel. For example, consider the SafeHome product. Working as a team, software\\nengineering and business managers develop a list of prioritized business goals:\\n1. Improve our customers’ satisfaction with our products.\\n2. Make our products easier to use.\\n3. Reduce the time it takes us to get a new product to market.\\n4. Make support for our products easier.\\n5. Improve our overall profitability.\\nThe software organization examines each business goal and asks: “What activi-\\nties do we manage, execute, or support and what do we want to improve within\\nthese activities?” To answer these questions the SEI recommends the creation of an\\n“entity-question list” in which all things (entities) within the software process that\\nare managed or influenced by the software organization are noted.

Before the project can begin, the software\\nteam should estimate the work to be done, the resources that will be\\nrequired, and the time that will elapse from start to finish. Once these activities\\nare accomplished, the software team should establish a project schedule that de-\\nfines software engineering tasks and milestones, identifies who is responsible for\\nconducting each task, and specifies the intertask dependencies that may have a\\nstrong bearing on progress.\\nIn an excellent guide to “software project survival,” Steve McConnell [McC98]\\npresents a real-world view of project planning:\\nMany technical workers would rather do technical work than spend time planning.\\nMany technical managers do not have sufficient training in technical management to \\n691\\nCHAPTER\\n26\\nESTIMATION FOR\\nSOFTWARE PROJECTS\\nWhat is it? A real need for software\\nhas been established; stakeholders\\nare onboard, software engineers are\\nready to start, and the project is\\nabout to begin. But how do you proceed? Soft-\\nware project planning encompasses five major\\nactivities—estimation, scheduling, risk analysis,\\nquality management planning, and change\\nmanagement planning. In the context of this\\nchapter, we consider only estimation—your\\nattempt to determine how much money, effort,\\nresources, and time it will take to build a specific\\nsoftware-based system or product.\\nWho does it? Software project managers—using\\ninformation solicited from project stakeholders\\nand software metrics data collected from past\\nprojects.\\nWhy is it important? Would you build a house\\nwithout knowing how much you were about to\\nspend, the tasks that you need to perform, and\\nthe time line for the work to be conducted? Of\\ncourse not, and since most computer-based\\nsystems and products cost considerably more\\nto build than a large house, it would seem\\nQUICK\\nLOOK\\nreasonable to develop an estimate before you\\nstart creating the software.\\nWhat are the steps? Estimation begins with a\\ndescription of the scope of the problem. The\\nproblem is then decomposed into a set of smaller\\nproblems, and each of these is estimated using\\nhistorical data and experience as guides. Prob-\\nlem complexity and risk are considered before a\\nfinal estimate is made.\\nWhat is the work product? A simple table delin-\\neating the tasks to be performed, the functions to\\nbe implemented, and the cost, effort, and time\\ninvolved for each is generated.\\nHow do I ensure that I’ve done it right? That’s\\nhard, because you won’t really know until the\\nproject has been completed. However, if you\\nhave experience and follow a systematic\\napproach, generate estimates using solid histor-\\nical data, create estimation data points using at\\nleast two different methods, establish a realistic\\nschedule, and continually adapt it as the project\\nmoves forward, you can feel confident that\\nyou’ve given it your best shot.\\nKEY\\nCONCEPTS\\nestimation  . . . .692\\nagile  . . . . . . .713\\nempirical\\nmodels  . . . . . .708\\nFP-based  . . . .702\\nobject-oriented\\nprojects  . . . . .712\\nproblem-\\nbased . . . . . . .699\\nprocess-\\nbased . . . . . . .703\\nreconciling  . . .707\\npre75977_ch26.qxd  11/27/08  6:26 PM  Page 691'),\n",

Since neither party\\nwants to do planning, it often doesn’t get done.\\nBut failure to plan is one of the most critical mistakes a project can make. . . effective\\nplanning is needed to resolve problems upstream [early in the project] at low cost, rather\\nthan downstream [late in the project] at high cost. The average project spends 80 percent\\nof its time on rework—fixing mistakes that were made earlier in the project.\\nMcConnell argues that every team can find the time to plan (and to adapt the plan\\nthroughout the project) simply by taking a small percentage of the time that would\\nhave been spent on rework that occurs because planning was not conducted.\\n26.1 O BSERVATIONS ON ESTIMATION\\nPlanning requires you to make an initial commitment, even though it’s likely that this\\n“commitment” will be proven wrong. Whenever estimates are made, you look into\\nthe future and accept some degree of uncertainty as a matter of course. To quote\\nFrederick Brooks [Bro95]:\\n. . . our techniques of estimating are poorly developed. More seriously, they reflect an\\nunvoiced assumption that is quite untrue, i.e., that all will go well. . . . because we are\\nuncertain of our estimates, software managers often lack the courteous stubbornness to\\nmake people wait for a good product.\\nAlthough estimating is as much art as it is science, this important action need not be\\nconducted in a haphazard manner. Useful techniques for time and effort estimation\\ndo exist. Process and project metrics can provide historical perspective and power-\\nful input for the generation of quantitative estimates. Past experience (of all people\\ninvolved) can aid immeasurably as estimates are developed and reviewed. Because\\nestimation lays a foundation for all other project planning actions, and project plan-\\nning provides the road map for successful software engineering, we would be ill\\nadvised to embark without it.\\nEstimation of resources, cost, and schedule for a software engineering effort\\nrequires experience, access to good historical information (metrics), and the courage\\nto commit to quantitative predictions when qualitative information is all that exists.\\nEstimation carries inherent risk,\\n1 and this risk leads to uncertainty.\\nProject complexity has a strong effect on the uncertainty inherent in planning.\\nComplexity, however, is a relative measure that is affected by familiarity with past\\neffort. The first-time developer of a sophisticated e-commerce application might con-\\nsider it to be exceedingly complex. However, a Web engineering team developing its\\ntenth e-commerce WebApp would consider such work run-of-the-mill. A number of\\nquantitative software complexity measures have been proposed [Zus97]. Such mea-\\nsures are applied at the design or code level and are therefore difficult to use during\\nuote:\\n“Good estimating\\napproaches and\\nsolid historical data\\noffer the best hope\\nthat reality will win\\nout over impossible\\ndemands.”\\nCaper Jones\\n1 Systematic techniques for risk analysis are presented in Chapter 28.\\nuse cases  . . . .705\\nWebApps  . . . .714\\nfeasibility . . . . .694\\nproject\\nplanning . . . . . .693\\nsoftware \\nequation . . . . . .711\\nsoftware \\nscope  . . . . . . . .694\\npre75977_ch26.qxd  11/27/08  6:26 PM  Page 692'),\n",

However, other, more subjective\\nassessments of complexity (e.g., function point complexity adjustment factors\\ndescribed in Chapter 23) can be established early in the planning process.\\nProject size is another important factor that can affect the accuracy and efficacy of\\nestimates. As size increases, the interdependency among various elements of the\\nsoftware grows rapidly.\\n2 Problem decomposition, an important approach to estimat-\\ning, becomes more difficult because the refinement of problem elements may still be\\nformidable. To paraphrase Murphy’s law: “What can go wrong will go wrong”—and\\nif there are more things that can fail, more things will fail.\\nThe degree of structural uncertainty also has an effect on estimation risk. In this\\ncontext, structure refers to the degree to which requirements have been solidified,\\nthe ease with which functions can be compartmentalized, and the hierarchical\\nnature of the information that must be processed.\\nThe availability of historical information has a strong influence on estimation risk.\\nBy looking back, you can emulate things that worked and improve areas where\\nproblems arose. When comprehensive software metrics (Chapter 25) are available\\nfor past projects, estimates can be made with greater assurance, schedules can\\nbe established to avoid past difficulties, and overall risk is reduced.\\nEstimation risk is measured by the degree of uncertainty in the quantitative\\nestimates established for resources, cost, and schedule. If project scope is poorly\\nunderstood or project requirements are subject to change, uncertainty and estimation\\nrisk become dangerously high. As a planner, you and the customer should recognize\\nthat variability in software requirements means instability in cost and schedule.\\nHowever, you should not become obsessive about estimation. Modern software\\nengineering approaches (e.g., evolutionary process models) take an iterative view\\nof development. In such approaches, it is possible—although not always politically\\nacceptable—to revisit the estimate (as more information is known) and revise it\\nwhen the customer makes changes to requirements.\\n26.2 T HE PROJECT PLANNING PROCESS\\nThe objective of software project planning is to provide a framework that enables the\\nmanager to make reasonable estimates of resources, cost, and schedule. In addition,\\nestimates should attempt to define best-case and worst-case scenarios so that proj-\\nect outcomes can be bounded. Although there is an inherent degree of uncertainty,\\nthe software team embarks on a plan that has been established as a consequence\\nof these tasks. Therefore, the plan must be adapted and updated as the project pro-\\nceeds. In the following sections, each of the actions associated with software project\\nplanning is discussed.\\nCHAPTER 26 ESTIMATION FOR SOFTWARE PROJECTS 693\\nuote:\\n“It is the mark of\\nan instructed mind\\nto rest satisfied\\nwith the degree of\\nprecision that the\\nnature of the sub-\\nject admits, and not\\nto seek exactness\\nwhen only an\\napproximation\\nof the truth is\\npossible.”\\nAristotle\\nProject complexity,\\nproject size, and the\\ndegree of structural\\nuncertainty all affect\\nthe reliability of\\nestimates.\\n2 Size often increases due to “scope creep” that occurs when problem requirements change.

Scope is defined using one of two techniques:\\n1. A narrative description of software scope is developed after communication\\nwith all stakeholders.\\n2. A set of use cases\\n3 is developed by end users.\\nFunctions described in the statement of scope (or within the use cases) are evaluated\\nand in some cases refined to provide more detail prior to the beginning of estimation.\\nBecause both cost and schedule estimates are functionally oriented, some degree of\\ndecomposition is often useful. Performance considerations encompass processing\\nand response time requirements. Constraints identify limits placed on the software by\\nexternal hardware, available memory, or other existing systems.\\nOnce scope has been identified (with the concurrence of the customer), it is rea-\\nsonable to ask: “Can we build software to meet this scope? Is the project feasible?”\\nAll too often, software engineers rush past these questions (or are pushed past\\nthem by impatient managers or other stakeholders), only to become mired in a\\nproject that is doomed from the onset. Putnam and Myers [Put97a] address this\\nissue when they write:\\n[N]ot everything imaginable is feasible, not even in software, evanescent as it may appear\\nto outsiders. On the contrary, software feasibility has four solid dimensions: Technology—\\nIs a project technically feasible? Is it within the state of the art? Can defects be reduced to\\na level matching the application’s needs? Finance—Is it financially feasible? Can devel-\\nopment be completed at a cost the software organization, its client, or the market can\\n3 Use cases have been discussed in detail throughout Part 2 of this book. A use case is a scenario-\\nbased description of the user’s interaction with the software from the user’s point of view.\\nProject feasibility is\\nimportant, but a\\nconsideration of\\nbusiness need is even\\nmore important.

This is a crucial, although often overlooked, part of the estimation process.\\n26.4 R ESOURCES\\nThe second planning task is estimation of the resources required to accomplish the\\nsoftware development effort.

Each resource is specified with\\nfour characteristics: description of the resource, a statement of availability, time\\nwhen the resource will be required, and duration of time that the resource will be\\napplied.

For\\nlarger projects, the software team may be geographically dispersed across a number\\nof different locations.

Techniques for\\nestimating effort are discussed later in this chapter.\\n26.4.2 Reusable Software Resources\\nComponent-based software engineering (CBSE)4 emphasizes reusability—that is, the\\ncreation and reuse of software building blocks. Such building blocks, often called\\ncomponents, must be cataloged for easy reference, standardized for easy application,\\nand validated for easy integration. Bennatan [Ben00] suggests four software\\nresource categories that should be considered as planning proceeds:\\nOff-the-shelf components. Existing software that can be acquired from a third\\nparty or from a past project. COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) components are pur-\\nchased from a third party, are ready for use on the current project, and have been\\nfully validated.\\nFull-experience components. Existing specifications, designs, code, or test data\\ndeveloped for past projects that are similar to the software to be built for the\\ncurrent project. Members of the current software team have had full experience\\nin the application area represented by these components. Therefore, modifications\\nrequired for full-experience components will be relatively low risk.\\nPartial-experience components. Existing specifications, designs, code, or test data\\ndeveloped for past projects that are related to the software to be built for the cur-\\nrent project but will require substantial modification. Members of the current soft-\\nware team have only limited experience in the application area represented by\\nthese components. Therefore, modifications required for partial-experience com-\\nponents have a fair degree of risk.\\nNew components. Software components must be built by the software team\\nspecifically for the needs of the current project.\\nIronically, reusable software components are often neglected during planning, only\\nto become a paramount concern later in the software process. It is better to specify\\nsoftware resource requirements early. In this way technical evaluation of the alter-\\nnatives can be conducted and timely acquisition can occur.\\n26.4.3 Environmental Resources\\nThe environment that supports a software project, often called the software engi-\\nneering environment (SEE), incorporates hardware and software.

Too many\\nvariables—human, technical, environmental, political—can affect the ultimate cost\\nof software and effort applied to develop it. However, software project estimation\\ncan be transformed from a black art to a series of systematic steps that provide esti-\\nmates with acceptable risk. To achieve reliable cost and effort estimates, a number\\nof options arise:\\n1. Delay estimation until late in the project (obviously, we can achieve 100 per-\\ncent accurate estimates after the project is complete!).\\n2. Base estimates on similar projects that have already been completed.\\n3. Use relatively simple decomposition techniques to generate project cost and\\neffort estimates.\\n4. Use one or more empirical models for software cost and effort estimation.\\nUnfortunately, the first option, however attractive, is not practical. Cost estimates\\nmust be provided up-front. However, you should recognize that the longer you wait,\\nthe more you know, and the more you know, the less likely you are to make serious\\nerrors in your estimates.\\nThe second option can work reasonably well, if the current project is quite similar\\nto past efforts and other project influences (e.g., the customer, business conditions,\\nthe software engineering environment, deadlines) are roughly equivalent. Unfortu-\\nnately, past experience has not always been a good indicator of future results.\\nThe remaining options are viable approaches to software project estimation.\\nIdeally, the techniques noted for each option should be applied in tandem; each used\\nas a cross-check for the other.

By decomposing a project into major func-\\ntions and related software engineering activities, cost and effort estimation can be\\nperformed in a stepwise fashion.

A model is based on experience (historical data) and\\ntakes the form\\nd /H11005f (v\\ni)\\nwhere d is one of a number of estimated values (e.g., effort, cost, project duration)\\nand vi are selected independent parameters (e.g., estimated LOC or FP).\\nAutomated estimation tools implement one or more decomposition techniques or\\nempirical models and provide an attractive option for estimating. In such systems,\\nthe characteristics of the development organization (e.g., experience, environment)\\nand the software to be developed are described. Cost and effort estimates are derived\\nfrom these data.\\nEach of the viable software cost estimation options is only as good as the histor-\\nical data used to seed the estimate. If no historical data exist, costing rests on a very\\nshaky foundation. In Chapter 25, we examined the characteristics of some of the\\nsoftware metrics that provide the basis for historical estimation data.\\n26.6 D ECOMPOSITION TECHNIQUES\\nSoftware project estimation is a form of problem solving, and in most cases, the\\nproblem to be solved (i.e., developing a cost and effort estimate for a software\\nproject) is too complex to be considered in one piece. For this reason, you should\\ndecompose the problem, recharacterizing it as a set of smaller (and hopefully, more\\nmanageable) problems.\\nIn Chapter 24, the decomposition approach was discussed from two different points\\nof view: decomposition of the problem and decomposition of the process. Estimation\\nuses one or both forms of partitioning. But before an estimate can be made, you must\\nunderstand the scope of the software to be built and generate an estimate of its “size.”\\n26.6.1 Software Sizing\\nThe accuracy of a software project estimate is predicated on a number of things:\\n(1) the degree to which you have properly estimated the size of the product to be built;\\n(2) the ability to translate the size estimate into human effort, calendar time, and dol-\\nlars (a function of the availability of reliable software metrics from past projects);\\n(3) the degree to which the project plan reflects the abilities of the software team; and\\n(4) the stability of product requirements and the environment that supports the soft-\\nware engineering effort.\\nIn this section, I consider the software sizing problem.

In the context of project planning,\\nsize refers to a quantifiable outcome of the software project. If a direct approach is\\ntaken, size can be measured in lines of code (LOC). If an indirect approach is chosen,\\nsize is represented as function points (FP).\\nPutnam and Myers [Put92] suggest four different approaches to the sizing problem:\\n• “Fuzzy logic” sizing.This approach uses the approximate reasoning tech-\\nniques that are the cornerstone of fuzzy logic. To apply this approach, the\\nplanner must identify the type of application, establish its magnitude on a\\nqualitative scale, and then refine the magnitude within the original range.\\n• Function point sizing. The planner develops estimates of the information\\ndomain characteristics discussed in Chapter 23.\\n• Standard component sizing. Software is composed of a number of different\\n“standard components” that are generic to a particular application area. For\\nexample, the standard components for an information system are subsys-\\ntems, modules, screens, reports, interactive programs, batch programs, files,\\nLOC, and object-level instructions. The project planner estimates the number\\nof occurrences of each standard component and then uses historical project\\ndata to estimate the delivered size per standard component.\\n• Change sizing. This approach is used when a project encompasses the use of\\nexisting software that must be modified in some way as part of a project. The\\nplanner estimates the number and type (e.g., reuse, adding code, changing\\ncode, deleting code) of modifications that must be accomplished.\\nPutnam and Myers suggest that the results of each of these sizing approaches be\\ncombined statistically to create a three-point or expected-value estimate. This is\\naccomplished by developing optimistic (low), most likely, and pessimistic (high) val-\\nues for size and combining them using Equation (26.1), described in Section 26.6.2.\\n26.6.2 Problem-Based Estimation\\nIn Chapter 25, lines of code and function points were described as measures from\\nwhich productivity metrics can be computed. LOC and FP data are used in two ways\\nduring software project estimation: (1) as estimation variables to “size” each element\\nof the software and (2) as baseline metrics collected from past projects and used in\\nconjunction with estimation variables to develop cost and effort projections.\\nLOC and FP estimation are distinct estimation techniques. Yet both have a num-\\nber of characteristics in common. You begin with a bounded statement of software\\nscope and from this statement attempt to decompose the statement of scope into\\nproblem functions that can each be estimated individually. LOC or FP (the estima-\\ntion variable) is then estimated for each function. Alternatively, you may choose\\nanother component for sizing, such as classes or objects, changes, or business\\nprocesses affected.\\nCHAPTER 26 ESTIMATION FOR SOFTWARE PROJECTS 699\\nHow do we\\nsize the\\nsoftware that\\nwe’re planning\\nto build?\\n?\\nWhat do\\nLOC- and \\nFP-based\\nestimation have\\nin common?\\n?\\npre75977_ch26.qxd  11/27/08  6:26 PM  Page 699'),\n",

Func-\\ntion estimates are combined to produce an overall estimate for the entire project.\\nIt is important to note, however, that there is often substantial scatter in produc-\\ntivity metrics for an organization, making the use of a single-baseline productivity\\nmetric suspect. In general, LOC/pm or FP/pm averages should be computed by proj-\\nect domain. That is, projects should be grouped by team size, application area, com-\\nplexity, and other relevant parameters. Local domain averages should then be\\ncomputed. When a new project is estimated, it should first be allocated to a domain,\\nand then the appropriate domain average for past productivity should be used in\\ngenerating the estimate.\\nThe LOC and FP estimation techniques differ in the level of detail required for de-\\ncomposition and the target of the partitioning. When LOC is used as the estimation\\nvariable, decomposition is absolutely essential and is often taken to considerable\\nlevels of detail. The greater the degree of partitioning, the more likely reasonably ac-\\ncurate estimates of LOC can be developed.\\nFor FP estimates, decomposition works differently. Rather than focusing on func-\\ntion, each of the information domain characteristics—inputs, outputs, data files, in-\\nquiries, and external interfaces—as well as the 14 complexity adjustment values\\ndiscussed in Chapter 23 are estimated. The resultant estimates can then be used to\\nderive an FP value that can be tied to past data and used to generate an estimate.\\nRegardless of the estimation variable that is used, you should begin by estimat-\\ning a range of values for each function or information domain value. Using histor-\\nical data or (when all else fails) intuition, estimate an optimistic, most likely, and\\npessimistic size value for each function or count for each information domain\\nvalue. An implicit indication of the degree of uncertainty is provided when a range\\nof values is specified.\\nA three-point or expected value can then be computed. The expected valuefor the\\nestimation variable (size) Scan be computed as a weighted average of the optimistic\\n(s\\nopt), most likely (sm), and pessimistic (spess) estimates.

These are noted in the total row at the bottom of the table.\\nHorizontal and vertical totals provide an indication of estimated effort required for\\nanalysis, design, code, and test. It should be noted that 53 percent of all effort is ex-\\npended on front-end engineering tasks (requirements analysis and design), indicat-\\ning the relative importance of this work.\\nBased on an average burdened labor rate of $8000 per month, the total estimated\\nproject cost is $368,000 and the estimated effort is 46 person-months. If desired,\\nlabor rates could be associated with each framework activity or software engineer-\\ning task and computed separately.\\n26.6.7 Estimation with Use Cases\\nAs I have noted throughout Part 2 of this book, use cases provide a software team\\nwith insight into software scope and requirements. However, developing an estima-\\ntion approach with use cases is problematic for the following reasons [Smi99]:\\n• Use cases are described using many different formats and styles—there is no\\nstandard form.\\n• Use cases represent an external view (the user’s view) of the software and\\ncan therefore be written at many different levels of abstraction.\\n• Use cases do not address the complexity of the functions and features that\\nare described.\\n• Use cases can describe complex behavior (e.g., interactions) that involve\\nmany functions and features.\\nUnlike an LOC or a function point, one person’s “use case” may require months of\\neffort while another person’s use case may be implemented in a day or two.\\nAlthough a number of investigators have considered use cases as an estimation\\ninput, no proven estimation method has emerged to date.\\n9 Smith [Smi99] suggests\\nthat use cases can be used for estimation, but only if they are considered within the\\ncontext of the “structural hierarchy” that they are used to describe.\\nSmith argues that any level of this structural hierarchy can be described by no\\nmore than 10 use cases. Each of these use cases would encompass no more than 30\\ndistinct scenarios. Obviously, use cases that describe a large system are written at a\\nmuch higher level of abstraction (and represent considerably more development\\neffort) than use cases that are written to describe a single subsystem. Therefore,\\nCHAPTER 26 ESTIMATION FOR SOFTWARE PROJECTS 705\\nuote:\\n“It’s best to\\nunderstand the\\nbackground of an\\nestimate before\\nyou use it.”\\nBarry Boehm\\nand Richard\\nFairley\\nWhy is it\\ndifficult to\\ndevelop an\\nestimation\\ntechnique using\\nuse cases?\\n?\\n9 Recent work in the derivation of use-case points [Cle06] may ultimately lead to a workable\\nestimation approach using use cases.\\npre75977_ch26.qxd  11/27/08  6:26 PM  Page 705'),\n",

Six use cases describe the user interface\\nsubsystem. Each use case is described by no more than 10 scenarios and has an\\naverage length of six pages. The engineering subsystem group is described by 10 use\\ncases (these are considered to be at a higher level of the structural hierarchy).

Although many\\nautomated estimation tools exist (see sidebar later in this\\nchapter), all exhibit the same general characteristics and\\nall perform the following six generic functions [Jon96]:\\n1. Sizing of project deliverables.The “size” of one or\\nmore software work products is estimated. Work\\nproducts include the external representation of\\nsoftware (e.g., screen, reports), the software itself\\n(e.g., KLOC), functionality delivered (e.g., function\\npoints), and descriptive information (e.g., documents).\\n2. Selecting project activities. The appropriate process\\nframework is selected, and the software engineering\\ntask set is specified.\\n3. Predicting staffing levels. The number of people who\\nwill be available to do the work is specified. Because\\nthe relationship between people available and work\\n(predicted effort) is highly nonlinear, this is an\\nimportant input.\\n4. Predicting software effort. Estimation tools use one\\nor more models (Section 26.7) that relate the size of\\nthe project deliverables to the effort required to\\nproduce them.\\n5. Predicting software cost. Given the results of step 4,\\ncosts can be computed by allocating labor rates to\\nthe project activities noted in step 2.\\n6. Predicting software schedules. When effort, staffing\\nlevel, and project activities are known, a draft\\nschedule can be produced by allocating labor across\\nsoftware engineering activities based on\\nrecommended models for effort distribution\\ndiscussed later in this chapter.\\nWhen different estimation tools are applied to the same\\nproject data, a relatively large variation in estimated\\nresults can be encountered. More important, predicted\\nvalues sometimes are significantly different than actual\\nvalues. This reinforces the notion that the output of\\nestimation tools should be used as one “data point” from\\nwhich estimates are derived—not as the only source for\\nan estimate.\\n11 An empirical model using use cases as the independent variable is suggested in Section 26.6.6.\\nHowever, relatively few have appeared in the literature to date.\\nAn estimation model\\nreflects the population\\nof projects from which\\nit has been derived.\\nTherefore, the model is\\ndomain sensitive.\\npre75977_ch26.qxd  11/27/08  6:26 PM  Page 708'),\n",

It has evolved into\\na more comprehensive estimation model, called COCOMO II [Boe00]. Like its predeces-\\nsor, COCOMO II is actually a hierarchy of estimation models that address the following\\nareas:\\n• Application composition model. Used during the early stages of software engi-\\nneering, when prototyping of user interfaces, consideration of software and\\nsystem interaction, assessment of performance, and evaluation of technology\\nmaturity are paramount.\\n• Early design stage model. Used once requirements have been stabilized and\\nbasic software architecture has been established.\\n• Post-architecture-stage model. Used during the construction of the software.\\nLike all estimation models for software, the COCOMO II models require sizing\\ninformation. Three different sizing options are available as part of the model\\nhierarchy: object points, function points, and lines of source code.\\nCHAPTER 26 ESTIMATION FOR SOFTWARE PROJECTS 709\\nNone of these models\\nshould be used without\\ncareful calibration to\\nyour environment.\\nWebRef\\nDetailed information on\\nCOCOMO II, including\\ndownloadable software,\\ncan be obtained at \\nsunset.usc.edu/\\nresearch/\\nCOCOMOII/\\ncocomo_main.html.\\npre75977_ch26.qxd  11/27/08  6:26 PM  Page 709'),\n",

However, when a software team encounters an extremely short\\nproject duration (weeks rather than months) that is likely to have a continuing stream\\nof changes, project planning in general and estimation in particular should be abbre-\\nviated.\\n14 In the sections that follow, I examine two specialized estimation techniques.\\n26.9.1 Estimation for Agile Development\\nBecause the requirements for an agile project (Chapter 3) are defined by a set of user\\nscenarios (e.g., “stories” in Extreme Programming), it is possible to develop an esti-\\nmation approach that is informal, reasonably disciplined, and meaningful within the\\ncontext of project planning for each software increment. Estimation for agile proj-\\nects uses a decomposition approach that encompasses the following steps:\\n1. Each user scenario (the equivalent of a mini use case created at the very\\nstart of a project by end users or other stakeholders) is considered separately\\nfor estimation purposes.\\n2. The scenario is decomposed into the set of software engineering tasks that\\nwill be required to develop it.\\n3a. The effort required for each task is estimated separately. Note: Estimation can\\nbe based on historical data, an empirical model, or “experience.”\\n3b.

A modified function point\\nmeasure, coupled with the steps outlined in Section 26.9.1, can be used to develop\\nan estimate for the WebApp. Roetzheim [Roe00] suggests the following approach\\nwhen adapting function points for WebApp estimation:\\n• Inputs are each input screen or form (for example, CGI or Java), each maintenance\\nscreen, and if you use a tab notebook metaphor anywhere, each tab.\\n• Outputs are each static Web page, each dynamic Web page script (for example, ASP,\\nISAPI, or other DHTML script), and each report (whether Web based or administrative\\nin nature).\\n• Tables are each logical table in the database plus, if you are using XML to store data in\\na file, each XML object (or collection of XML attributes).\\n• Interfaces retain their definition as logical files (for example, unique record formats) into\\nour out-of-the-system boundaries.\\n• Queries are each externally published or use a message-oriented interface. A typical\\nexample is DCOM or COM external references.\\nFunction points (interpreted in the manner noted) are a reasonable indicator of\\nvolume for a WebApp.\\nMendes and her colleagues [Men01] suggest that the volume of a WebApp is best\\ndetermined by collecting measures (called “predictor variables”) associated with the\\napplication (e.g., page count, media count, function count), its Web page characteris-\\ntics (e.g., page complexity, linking complexity, graphic complexity), media characteris-\\ntics (e.g., media duration), and functional characteristics (e.g., code length, reused code\\nlength). These measures can be used to develop empirical estimation models for total\\nproject effort, page authoring effort, media authoring effort, and scripting effort.

In some cases (e.g., low-cost PC software),\\nit is less expensive to purchase and experiment than to conduct a lengthy evaluation\\nof potential software packages. In the final analysis, the make/buy decision is made\\nbased on the following conditions: (1) Will the delivery date of the software product be\\nsooner than that for internally developed software? (2) Will the cost of acquisition plus\\nthe cost of customization be less than the cost of developing the software internally?\\n(3) Will the cost of outside support (e.g., a maintenance contract) be less than the cost\\nof internal support?

Software engineering activities are\\ncontracted to a third party who does the work at lower cost and, hopefully, higher\\nquality. Software work conducted within a company is reduced to a contract man-\\nagement activity.\\n17\\nThe decision to outsource can be either strategic or tactical. At the strategic level,\\nbusiness managers consider whether a significant portion of all software work can be\\ncontracted to others. At the tactical level, a project manager determines whether part\\nor all of a project can be best accomplished by subcontracting the software work.\\nRegardless of the breadth of focus, the outsourcing decision is often a financial\\none. A detailed discussion of the financial analysis for outsourcing is beyond the\\nscope of this book and is best left to others (e.g., [Min95]). However, a brief review\\nof the pros and cons of the decision is worthwhile.\\nOn the positive side, cost savings can usually be achieved by reducing the num-\\nber of software people and the facilities (e.g., computers, infrastructure) that support\\nthem. On the negative side, a company loses some control over the software that it\\nneeds. Since software is a technology that differentiates its systems, services, and\\nproducts, a company runs the risk of putting the fate of its competitiveness into the\\nhands of a third party.\\nThe trend toward outsourcing will undoubtedly continue. The only way to blunt the\\ntrend is to recognize that software work is extremely competitive at all levels. The only\\nway to survive is to become as competitive as the outsourcing vendors themselves.\\nCHAPTER 26 ESTIMATION FOR SOFTWARE PROJECTS 717\\nuote:\\n“As a rule\\noutsourcing requires\\neven more skillful\\nmanagement\\nthan in-house\\ndevelopment.”\\nSteve McConnell\\n17 Outsourcing can be viewed more generally as any activity that leads to the acquisition of software\\nor software components from a source outside the software engineering organization.\\nOutsourcing\\nThe scene: Meeting room at CPI\\nCorporation early in the project.\\nThe players: Mal Golden, senior manager, product\\ndevelopment; Lee Warren, engineering manager; Joe\\nCamalleri, executive VP, business development; and Doug\\nMiller, project manager, software engineering.\\nThe conversation:\\nJoe: We’re considering outsourcing the SafeHome\\nsoftware engineering portion of the product.\\nDoug (shocked): When did this happen?\\nLee: We got a quote from an offshore developer.

In addition, the planner must predict the resources (hardware and software)\\nthat will be required and the risk involved.\\nThe statement of scope helps the planner to develop estimates using one or more\\ntechniques that fall into two broad categories: decomposition and empirical model-\\ning. Decomposition techniques require a delineation of major software functions,\\nfollowed by estimates of either (1) the number of LOC, (2) selected values within the\\ninformation domain, (3) the number of use cases, (4) the number of person-months\\nrequired to implement each function, or (5) the number of person-months required\\nfor each software engineering activity. Empirical techniques use empirically derived\\nexpressions for effort and time to predict these project quantities. Automated tools\\ncan be used to implement a specific empirical model.\\nAccurate project estimates generally use at least two of the three techniques just\\nnoted. By comparing and reconciling estimates developed using different tech-\\nniques, the planner is more likely to derive an accurate estimate.

But common sense says that\\nlegitimacy must also be perceived by the people doing the work.\\nNapoleon once said: “Any commander-in-chief who undertakes to carry out a\\nplan which he considers defective is at fault; he must put forth his reasons, insist on\\nthe plan being changed, and finally tender his resignation rather than be the instru-\\nment of his army’s downfall.” These are strong words that many software project\\nmanagers should ponder.\\n1 In case you were wondering, this story is autobiographical.\\ntime-line\\ncharts  . . . . . . .732\\ntracking  . . . . . .734\\nwork\\nbreakdown . . . .732\\nuote:\\n“Excessive or\\nirrational schedules\\nare probably the\\nsingle most\\ndestructive\\ninfluence in all\\nof software.”\\nCapers Jones\\npre75977_ch27.qxd  11/27/08  6:27 PM  Page 722'),\n",

His\\nresponse was as simple as it was profound: “One day at a time.”\\nThe reality of a technical project (whether it involves building a hydroelectric plant\\nor developing an operating system) is that hundreds of small tasks must occur to\\naccomplish a larger goal. Some of these tasks lie outside the mainstream and may\\nbe completed without worry about impact on project completion date. Other tasks\\nlie on the “critical path.” If these “critical” tasks fall behind schedule, the completion\\ndate of the entire project is put into jeopardy.\\nAs a project manager, your objective is to define all project tasks, build a network\\nthat depicts their interdependencies, identify the tasks that are critical within the\\nnetwork, and then track their progress to ensure that delay is recognized “one day\\nat a time.” To accomplish this, you must have a schedule that has been defined at a\\ndegree of resolution that allows progress to be monitored and the project to be\\ncontrolled.\\nSoftware project scheduling is an action that distributes estimated effort across the\\nplanned project duration by allocating the effort to specific software engineering\\ntasks. It is important to note, however, that the schedule evolves over time. During\\nearly stages of project planning, a macroscopic schedule is developed. This type of\\nschedule identifies all major process framework activities and the product functions\\nto which they are applied. As the project gets under way, each entry on the macro-\\nscopic schedule is refined into a detailed schedule. Here, specific software actions\\nand tasks (required to accomplish an activity) are identified and scheduled.\\nScheduling for software engineering projects can be viewed from two rather dif-\\nferent perspectives. In the first, an end date for release of a computer-based system\\nhas already (and irrevocably) been established. The software organization is con-\\nstrained to distribute effort within the prescribed time frame. The second view of\\nsoftware scheduling assumes that rough chronological bounds have been discussed\\nbut that the end date is set by the software engineering organization. Effort is\\ndistributed to make best use of resources, and an end date is defined after careful\\nanalysis of the software. Unfortunately, the first situation is encountered far more\\nfrequently than the second.\\n724 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\nThe tasks required to\\nachieve a project\\nmanager’s objective\\nshould not be\\nperformed manually.\\nThere are many\\nexcellent scheduling\\ntools.

The project must be compartmentalized into a number of\\nmanageable activities and tasks. To accomplish compartmentalization, both the\\nproduct and the process are refined.\\nInterdependency. The interdependency of each compartmentalized activity or\\ntask must be determined. Some tasks must occur in sequence, while others can\\noccur in parallel. Some activities cannot commence until the work product pro-\\nduced by another is available. Other activities can occur independently.\\nTime allocation. Each task to be scheduled must be allocated some number of\\nwork units (e.g., person-days of effort). In addition, each task must be assigned a\\nstart date and a completion date that are a function of the interdependencies and\\nwhether work will be conducted on a full-time or part-time basis.\\nEffort validation. Every project has a defined number of people on the software\\nteam. As time allocation occurs, you must ensure that no more than the allocated\\nnumber of people has been scheduled at any given time. For example, consider a\\nproject that has three assigned software engineers (e.g., three person-days are\\navailable per day of assigned effort\\n4). On a given day, seven concurrent tasks must\\nbe accomplished. Each task requires 0.50 person-days of effort. More effort has\\nbeen allocated than there are people to do the work.\\nDefined responsibilities. Every task that is scheduled should be assigned to a\\nspecific team member.\\nDefined outcomes. Every task that is scheduled should have a defined outcome.\\nFor software projects, the outcome is normally a work product (e.g., the design of\\na component) or a part of a work product. Work products are often combined in\\ndeliverables.\\nDefined milestones. Every task or group of tasks should be associated with a\\nproject milestone. A milestone is accomplished when one or more work products\\nhas been reviewed for quality (Chapter 15) and has been approved.\\nEach of these principles is applied as the project schedule evolves.\\n27.2.2 The Relationship Between People and Effort\\nIn a small software development project a single person can analyze requirements,\\nperform design, generate code, and conduct tests. As the size of a project increases,\\nmore people must become involved. (We can rarely afford the luxury of approaching\\na 10 person-year effort with one person working for 10 years!)\\nCHAPTER 27 PROJECT SCHEDULING 725\\n4 In reality, less than three person-days of effort are available because of unrelated meetings, sick-\\nness, vacation, and a variety of other reasons.

The people who are added must learn the system, and\\nthe people who teach them are the same people who were doing the work. While\\nteaching, no work is done, and the project falls further behind.\\nIn addition to the time it takes to learn the system, more people increase the num-\\nber of communication paths and the complexity of communication throughout a\\nproject.

The PNR curve also indicates that the lowest cost delivery option,\\nt\\no /H110052td. The implication here is that delaying project delivery can reduce costs\\nsignificantly. Of course, this must be weighed against the business cost associated\\nwith the delay.\\nThe software equation [Put92] introduced in Chapter 26 is derived from the PNR\\ncurve and demonstrates the highly nonlinear relationship between chronological\\ntime to complete a project and human effort applied to the project. The number of\\ndelivered lines of code (source statements), L, is related to effort and development\\ntime by the equation:\\nL /H11005P /H11003E\\n1/3t4/3\\nwhere E is development effort in person-months, P is a productivity parameter that\\nreflects a variety of factors that lead to high-quality software engineering work\\n(typical values for P range between 2000 and 12,000), and t is the project duration in\\ncalendar months.\\nRearranging this software equation, we can arrive at an expression for develop-\\nment effort E:\\nE /H11005 (27.1)\\nwhere E is the effort expended (in person-years) over the entire life cycle for software\\ndevelopment and maintenance and tis the development time in years. The equation\\nfor development effort can be related to development cost by the inclusion of a\\nburdened labor rate factor ($/person-year).\\nThis leads to some interesting results. Consider a complex, real-time software\\nproject estimated at 33,000 LOC, 12 person-years of effort. If eight people are assigned\\nto the project team, the project can be completed in approximately 1.3 years. If, how-\\never, we extend the end date to 1.75 years, the highly nonlinear nature of the model\\ndescribed in Equation (27.1) yields:\\nE /H11005 ~ 3.8 person-years\\nThis implies that, by extending the end date by six months, we can reduce the\\nnumber of people from eight to four!

A recommended distribution of effort across the software process is\\noften referred to as the 40–20–40 rule. Forty percent of all effort is allocated to front-\\nend analysis and design. A similar percentage is applied to back-end testing. You can\\ncorrectly infer that coding (20 percent of effort) is deemphasized.\\nThis effort distribution should be used as a guideline only.\\n6 The characteristics of\\neach project dictate the distribution of effort. Work expended on project planning\\nrarely accounts for more than 2 to 3 percent of effort, unless the plan commits an\\norganization to large expenditures with high risk. Customer communication and\\nrequirements analysis may comprise 10 to 25 percent of project effort. Effort ex-\\npended on analysis or prototyping should increase in direct proportion with project\\nsize and complexity. A range of 20 to 25 percent of effort is normally applied to soft-\\nware design. Time expended for design review and subsequent iteration must also\\nbe considered.\\nBecause of the effort applied to software design, code should follow with rela-\\ntively little difficulty. A range of 15 to 20 percent of overall effort can be achieved.\\nTesting and subsequent debugging can account for 30 to 40 percent of software\\ndevelopment effort. The criticality of the software often dictates the amount of test-\\ning that is required.

No single task set is appropriate for all projects.\\nThe set of tasks that would be appropriate for a large, complex system would likely\\nbe perceived as overkill for a small, relatively simple software product. Therefore, an\\neffective software process should define a collection of task sets, each designed to\\nmeet the needs of different types of projects.\\nAs I noted in Chapter 2, a task set is a collection of software engineering work\\ntasks, milestones, work products, and quality assurance filters that must be accom-\\nplished to complete a particular project. The task set must provide enough discipline\\nto achieve high software quality. But, at the same time, it must not burden the proj-\\nect team with unnecessary work.\\nIn order to develop a project schedule, a task set must be distributed on the proj-\\nect time line. The task set will vary depending upon the project type and the degree\\nof rigor with which the software team decides to do its work. Although it is difficult\\n728 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\n6 Today, the 40-20-40 rule is under attack. Some believe that more than 40 percent of overall effort\\nshould be expended during analysis and design.

In\\naddition, when more than one person is involved in a software engineering project,\\nit is likely that development activities and tasks will be performed in parallel. When\\nthis occurs, concurrent tasks must be coordinated so that they will be complete when\\nlater tasks require their work product(s).\\nA task network, also called an activity network, is a graphic representation of the\\ntask flow for a project. It is sometimes used as the mechanism through which task\\nsequence and dependencies are input to an automated project scheduling tool. In its\\nsimplest form (used when creating a macroscopic schedule), the task network\\ndepicts major software engineering actions. Figure 27.2 shows a schematic task\\nnetwork for a concept development project.\\nThe concurrent nature of software engineering actions leads to a number of\\nimportant scheduling requirements. Because parallel tasks occur asynchronously,\\nyou should determine intertask dependencies to ensure continuous progress toward\\ncompletion. In addition, you should be aware of those tasks that lie on the critical\\npath. That is, tasks that must be completed on schedule if the project as a whole is\\nto be completed on schedule. These issues are discussed in more detail later in this\\nchapter.\\nIt is important to note that the task network shown in Figure 27.2 is macroscopic.\\nIn a detailed task network (a precursor to a detailed schedule), each action shown in\\nthe figure would be expanded.

After a\\nproblem has been diagnosed, additional resources may be focused on the problem\\narea: staff may be redeployed or the project schedule can be redefined.\\nWhen faced with severe deadline pressure, experienced project managers some-\\ntimes use a project scheduling and control technique called time-boxing [Jal04]. The\\ntime-boxing strategy recognizes that the complete product may not be deliverable by\\nthe predefined deadline. Therefore, an incremental software paradigm (Chapter 2) is\\nchosen, and a schedule is derived for each incremental delivery.\\nThe tasks associated with each increment are then time-boxed. This means that\\nthe schedule for each task is adjusted by working backward from the delivery date\\nfor the increment. A “box” is put around each task. When a task hits the boundary of\\nits time box (plus or minus 10 percent), work stops and the next task begins.\\nThe initial reaction to the time-boxing approach is often negative: “If the work\\nisn’t finished, how can we proceed?” The answer lies in the way work is accom-\\nplished. By the time the time-box boundary is encountered, it is likely that 90 percent\\nof the task has been completed.\\n9 The remaining 10 percent, although important, can\\n(1) be delayed until the next increment or (2) be completed later if required.

This is accomplished by allocating\\nthe effort to specific tasks. It is important to note, however, that the overall WebApp\\nschedule evolves over time. During the first iteration, a macroscopic schedule is\\ndeveloped. This type of schedule identifies all WebApp increments and projects the\\ndates on which each will be deployed. As the development of an increment gets\\nunder way, the entry for the increment on the macroscopic schedule is refined into\\na detailed schedule. Here, specific development tasks (required to accomplish an\\nactivity) are identified and scheduled.\\nAs an example of macroscopic scheduling, consider the SafeHomeAssured.com\\nWebApp. Recalling earlier discussions of SafeHomeAssured.com, seven increments\\ncan be identified for the Web-based component of the project:\\nIncrement 1: Basic company and product information\\nIncrement 2: Detailed product information and downloads\\nIncrement 3: Product quotes and processing product orders\\nIncrement 4: Space layout and security system design\\n736 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\nDebugging and testing\\noccur in concert with\\none another.

It is reasonable to ask whether\\nthere is a quantitative technique for assessing progress as the software team pro-\\ngresses through the work tasks allocated to the project schedule. In fact, a technique\\nfor performing quantitative analysis of progress does exist. It is called earned value\\nanalysis (EVA). Humphrey [Hum95] discusses earned value in the following manner:\\nThe earned value system provides a common value scale for every [software project]\\ntask, regardless of the type of work being performed. The total hours to do the whole\\nproject are estimated, and every task is given an earned value based on its estimated\\npercentage of the total.\\nEarned value provides\\na quantitative\\nindication of progress.\\npre75977_ch27.qxd  11/27/08  6:28 PM  Page 739'),\n",

In fact, Fleming and Koppleman [Fle98] argue that earned\\nvalue analysis “provides accurate and reliable readings of performance from as early\\nas 15 percent into the project.” To determine the earned value, the following steps\\nare performed:\\n1. The budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS) is determined for each work task\\nrepresented in the schedule. During estimation, the work (in person-hours or\\nperson-days) of each software engineering task is planned. Hence, BCWS\\ni is\\nthe effort planned for work task i. To determine progress at a given point\\nalong the project schedule, the value of BCWS is the sum of the BCWSi values\\nfor all work tasks that should have been completed by that point in time on\\nthe project schedule.\\n2. The BCWS values for all work tasks are summed to derive the budget at\\ncompletion (BAC). Hence,\\nBAC /H11005/H20858(BCWS\\nk) for all tasks k\\n3. Next, the value for budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) is computed. The\\nvalue for BCWP is the sum of the BCWS values for all work tasks that have\\nactually been completed by a point in time on the project schedule.\\nWilkens [Wil99] notes that “the distinction between the BCWS and the BCWP is\\nthat the former represents the budget of the activities that were planned to be com-\\npleted and the latter represents the budget of the activities that actually were\\ncompleted.” Given values for BCWS, BAC, and BCWP, important progress indicators\\ncan be computed:\\nSchedule performance index, SPI /H11005\\nSchedule variance, SV /H11005BCWP /H11002BCWS\\nSPI is an indication of the efficiency with which the project is utilizing scheduled\\nresources.

When combined with estimation methods and risk\\nanalysis, scheduling establishes a road map for the project manager.\\nScheduling begins with process decomposition. The characteristics of the project\\nare used to adapt an appropriate task set for the work to be done. A task network\\ndepicts each engineering task, its dependency on other tasks, and its projected\\nduration. The task network is used to compute the critical path, a time-line chart, and\\na variety of project information. Using the schedule as a guide, you can track and\\ncontrol each step in the software process.\\nPROBLEMS AND POINTS TO PONDER\\n27.1. “Unreasonable” deadlines are a fact of life in the software business. How should you\\nproceed if you’re faced with one?\\n27.2. What is the difference between a macroscopic schedule and a detailed schedule? Is it\\npossible to manage a project if only a macroscopic schedule is developed? Why?\\n27.3. Is there ever a case where a software project milestone is not tied to a review? If so,\\nprovide one or more examples.\\n27.4. “Communication overhead” can occur when multiple people work on a software project.\\nThe time spent communicating with others reduces individual productively (LOC/month), and\\nthe result can be less productivity for the team. Illustrate (quantitatively) how engineers who are\\nwell versed in good software engineering practices and use technical reviews can increase the\\nproduction rate of a team (when compared to the sum of individual production rates). Hint: You\\ncan assume that reviews reduce rework and that rework can account for 20 to 40 percent of a\\nperson’s time.\\n27.5. Although adding people to a late software project can make it later, there are circum-\\nstances in which this is not true. Describe them.\\n27.6. The relationship between people and time is highly nonlinear.

Thus paradoxically, risk, like death and taxes, is one of the few\\ncertainties of life.\\nWhen you consider risk in the context of software engineering, Charette’s\\nthree conceptual underpinnings are always in evidence.

Risk analysis and\\nmanagement are actions that help\\na software team to understand and\\nmanage uncertainty. Many problems\\ncan plague a software project. A risk is a poten-\\ntial problem—it might happen, it might not. But,\\nregardless of the outcome, it’s a really good idea\\nto identify it, assess its probability of occurrence,\\nestimate its impact, and establish a contingency\\nplan should the problem actually occur.\\nWho does it? Everyone involved in the software\\nprocess—managers, software engineers, and\\nother stakeholders—participate in risk analysis\\nand management.\\nWhy is it important? Think about the Boy Scout\\nmotto: “Be prepared.” Software is a difficult un-\\ndertaking. Lots of things can go wrong, and\\nfrankly, many often do. It’s for this reason that\\nbeing prepared—understanding the risks and\\ntaking proactive measures to avoid or manage\\nthem—is a key element of good software project\\nmanagement.\\nQUICK\\nLOOK\\nWhat are the steps? Recognizing what can go\\nwrong is the first step, called “risk identifica-\\ntion.” Next, each risk is analyzed to determine\\nthe likelihood that it will occur and the damage\\nthat it will do if it does occur. Once this informa-\\ntion is established, risks are ranked, by proba-\\nbility and impact. Finally, a plan is developed to\\nmanage those risks that have high probability\\nand high impact.\\nWhat is the work product? A risk mitigation,\\nmonitoring, and management (RMMM) plan or\\na set of risk information sheets is produced.\\nHow do I ensure that I’ve done it right? The\\nrisks that are analyzed and managed should\\nbe derived from thorough study of the people,\\nthe product, the process, and the project.

In the movies that carried his name, Indiana Jones, when\\nfaced with overwhelming difficulty, would invariably say, “Don’t worry, I’ll think of\\nsomething!” Never worrying about problems until they happened, Indy would react\\nin some heroic way.\\nSadly, the average software project manager is not Indiana Jones and the mem-\\nbers of the software project team are not his trusty sidekicks. Yet, the majority of\\nsoftware teams rely solely on reactive risk strategies. At best, a reactive strategy\\nmonitors the project for likely risks. Resources are set aside to deal with them,\\nshould they become actual problems. More commonly, the software team does\\nnothing about risks until something goes wrong. Then, the team flies into action in\\nan attempt to correct the problem rapidly. This is often called a fire-fighting mode.\\nWhen this fails, “crisis management” [Cha92] takes over and the project is in real\\njeopardy.\\nA considerably more intelligent strategy for risk management is to be proactive.\\nA proactive strategy begins long before technical work is initiated. Potential risks are\\nidentified, their probability and impact are assessed, and they are ranked by impor-\\ntance. Then, the software team establishes a plan for managing risk. The primary\\nobjective is to avoid risk, but because not all risks can be avoided, the team works\\nto develop a contingency plan that will enable it to respond in a controlled and\\neffective manner. Throughout the remainder of this chapter, I discuss a proactive\\nstrategy for risk management.\\n28.2 S OFTWARE RISKS\\nAlthough there has been considerable debate about the proper definition for soft-\\nware risk, there is general agreement that risk always involves two character-\\nistics: uncertainty—the risk may or may not happen; that is, there are no 100 percent\\nCHAPTER 28 RISK MANAGEMENT 745\\nuote:\\n“If you don't\\nactively attack the\\nrisks, they will\\nactively attack\\nyou.”\\nTom Gilb\\npre75977_ch28.qxd  11/27/08  6:29 PM  Page 745\"),\n",

To accomplish\\nthis, different categories of risks are considered.\\nProject risks threaten the project plan. That is, if project risks become real, it is\\nlikely that the project schedule will slip and that costs will increase. Project risks\\nidentify potential budgetary, schedule, personnel (staffing and organization), re-\\nsource, stakeholder, and requirements problems and their impact on a software proj-\\nect. In Chapter 26, project complexity, size, and the degree of structural uncertainty\\nwere also defined as project (and estimation) risk factors.\\nTechnical risksthreaten the quality and timeliness of the software to be produced.\\nIf a technical risk becomes a reality, implementation may become difficult or impos-\\nsible. Technical risks identify potential design, implementation, interface, verifica-\\ntion, and maintenance problems. In addition, specification ambiguity, technical\\nuncertainty, technical obsolescence, and “leading-edge” technology are also risk\\nfactors. T echnical risks occur because the problem is harder to solve than you\\nthought it would be.\\nBusiness risks threaten the viability of the software to be built and often jeopard-\\nize the project or the product. Candidates for the top five business risks are (1) build-\\ning an excellent product or system that no one really wants (market risk), (2) building\\na product that no longer fits into the overall business strategy for the company\\n(strategic risk), (3) building a product that the sales force doesn’t understand how to\\nsell (sales risk), (4) losing the support of senior management due to a change in focus\\nor a change in people (management risk), and (5) losing budgetary or personnel\\ncommitment (budget risks).\\nIt is extremely important to note that simple risk categorization won’t always\\nwork. Some risks are simply unpredictable in advance.\\nAnother general categorization of risks has been proposed by Charette\\n[Cha89]. Known risks are those that can be uncovered after careful evaluation of\\nthe project plan, the business and technical environment in which the project is\\nbeing developed, and other reliable information sources (e.g., unrealistic delivery\\ndate, lack of documented requirements or software scope, poor development\\nenvironment). Predictable risks are extrapolated from past project experience\\n(e.g., staff turnover, poor communication with the customer, dilution of staff effort\\nas ongoing maintenance requests are serviced). Unpredictable risks are the joker\\nin the deck. They can and do occur, but they are extremely difficult to identify in\\nadvance.\\n746 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\nWhat types\\nof risks are\\nyou likely to\\nencounter as\\nsoftware is\\nbuilt?\\n?\\n1 A risk that is 100 percent probable is a constraint on the software project.\\nuote:\\n“Projects with no\\nreal risks are\\nlosers.

Generic risks are a\\npotential threat to every software project. Product-specific riskscan be identified only\\nby those with a clear understanding of the technology, the people, and the environ-\\nment that is specific to the software that is to be built. To identify product-specific\\nrisks, the project plan and the software statement of scope are examined, and an\\nanswer to the following question is developed: “What special characteristics of this\\nproduct may threaten our project plan?”\\nOne method for identifying risks is to create a risk item checklist. The checklist\\ncan be used for risk identification and focuses on some subset of known and pre-\\ndictable risks in the following generic subcategories:\\n• Product size—risks associated with the overall size of the software to be built\\nor modified.\\n• Business impact—risks associated with constraints imposed by management\\nor the marketplace.\\nCHAPTER 28 RISK MANAGEMENT 747\\nSeven Principles of Risk Management\\nThe Software Engineering Institute (SEI)\\n(www.sei.cmu.edu) identifies seven\\nprinciples that “provide a framework to accomplish\\neffective risk management.” They are:\\nMaintain a global perspective—view software risks\\nwithin the context of a system in which it is a\\ncomponent and the business problem that it is\\nintended to solve\\nTake a forward-looking view—think about the risks\\nthat may arise in the future (e.g., due to changes in the\\nsoftware); establish contingency plans so that future\\nevents are manageable.\\nEncourage open communication—if someone states\\na potential risk, don’t discount it. If a risk is proposed\\nin an informal manner, consider it.

The Air Force approach requires\\nthat the project manager identify the risk drivers that affect software risk components—\\nperformance, cost, support, and schedule. In the context of this discussion, the risk\\ncomponents are defined in the following manner:\\n• Performance risk—the degree of uncertainty that the product will meet its\\nrequirements and be fit for its intended use.\\n• Cost risk—the degree of uncertainty that the project budget will be\\nmaintained.\\n• Support risk—the degree of uncertainty that the resultant software will be\\neasy to correct, adapt, and enhance.\\n• Schedule risk—the degree of uncertainty that the project schedule will be\\nmaintained and that the product will be delivered on time.\\nThe impact of each risk driver on the risk component is divided into one of four\\nimpact categories—negligible, marginal, critical, or catastrophic. Referring to Fig-\\nure 28.1 [Boe89], a characterization of the potential consequences of errors (rows\\nlabeled 1) or a failure to achieve a desired outcome (rows labeled 2) are described.\\nThe impact category is chosen based on the characterization that best fits the\\ndescription in the table.\\n28.4 R ISK PROJECTION\\nRisk projection, also called risk estimation, attempts to rate each risk in two ways—\\n(1) the likelihood or probability that the risk is real and (2) the consequences of the\\nproblems associated with the risk, should it occur.

An effective strategy\\nmust consider three issues: risk avoidance, risk monitoring, and risk management\\nand contingency planning.\\nIf a software team adopts a proactive approach to risk, avoidance is always the\\nbest strategy. This is achieved by developing a plan for risk mitigation. For example,\\nassume that high staff turnover is noted as a project risk r\\n1. Based on past history and\\nmanagement intuition, the likelihood l 1 of high turnover is estimated to be 0.70\\n(70 percent, rather high) and the impact x1 is projected as critical. That is, high\\nturnover will have a critical impact on project cost and schedule.\\nTo mitigate this risk, you would develop a strategy for reducing turnover. Among\\nthe possible steps to be taken are:\\n• Meet with current staff to determine causes for turnover (e.g., poor working\\nconditions, low pay, competitive job market).\\n• Mitigate those causes that are under your control before the project starts.\\n• Once the project commences, assume turnover will occur and develop tech-\\nniques to ensure continuity when people leave.\\n• Organize project teams so that information about each development activity\\nis widely dispersed.\\nCHAPTER 28 RISK MANAGEMENT 755\\nWhat can\\nwe do to\\nmitigate a risk?\\n?\\nuote:\\n“If I take so many\\nprecautions, it is\\nbecause I leave\\nnothing to chance.”\\nNapolean\\npre75977_ch28.qxd  11/27/08  6:30 PM  Page 755'),\n",

The project man-\\nager monitors factors that may provide an indication of whether the risk is becom-\\ning more or less likely. In the case of high staff turnover, the general attitude of team\\nmembers based on project pressures, the degree to which the team has jelled, inter-\\npersonal relationships among team members, potential problems with compensa-\\ntion and benefits, and the availability of jobs within the company and outside it are\\nall monitored.\\nIn addition to monitoring these factors, a project manager should monitor the\\neffectiveness of risk mitigation steps. For example, a risk mitigation step noted here\\ncalled for the definition of work product standards and mechanisms to be sure that\\nwork products are developed in a timely manner. This is one mechanism for ensur-\\ning continuity, should a critical individual leave the project. The project manager\\nshould monitor work products carefully to ensure that each can stand on its own and\\nthat each imparts information that would be necessary if a newcomer were forced\\nto join the software team somewhere in the middle of the project.\\nRisk management and contingency planning assumes that mitigation efforts have\\nfailed and that the risk has become a reality. Continuing the example, the project is\\nwell under way and a number of people announce that they will be leaving. If the\\nmitigation strategy has been followed, backup is available, information is docu-\\nmented, and knowledge has been dispersed across the team. In addition, you can\\ntemporarily refocus resources (and readjust the project schedule) to those functions\\nthat are fully staffed, enabling newcomers who must be added to the team to “get\\nup to speed.” Those individuals who are leaving are asked to stop all work and spend\\ntheir last weeks in “knowledge transfer mode.” This might include video-based\\nknowledge capture, the development of “commentary documents or Wikis,” and/or\\nmeeting with other team members who will remain on the project.\\nIt is important to note that risk mitigation, monitoring, and management (RMMM)\\nsteps incur additional project cost. For example, spending the time to back up every\\ncritical technologist costs money. Part of risk management, therefore, is to evaluate\\nwhen the benefits accrued by the RMMM steps are outweighed by the costs associ-\\nated with implementing them. In essence, you perform a classic cost-benefit analy-\\nsis. If risk aversion steps for high turnover will increase both project cost and\\nduration by an estimated 15 percent, but the predominant cost factor is “backup,”\\nmanagement may decide not to implement this step.

If between three and seven\\nrisk management steps are identified for each, risk management may become a proj-\\nect in itself! For this reason, you should adapt the Pareto 80–20 rule to software risk.\\nExperience indicates that 80 percent of the overall project risk (i.e., 80 percent of the\\npotential for project failure) can be accounted for by only 20 percent of the identified\\nrisks. The work performed during earlier risk analysis steps will help you to deter-\\nmine which of the risks reside in that 20 percent (e.g., risks that lead to the highest\\nrisk exposure). For this reason, some of the risks identified, assessed, and projected\\nmay not make it into the RMMM plan—they don’t fall into the critical 20 percent (the\\nrisks with highest project priority).\\nRisk is not limited to the software project itself. Risks can occur after the software\\nhas been successfully developed and delivered to the customer. These risks are typ-\\nically associated with the consequences of software failure in the field.\\nSoftware safety and hazard analysis (e.g., [Dun02], [Her00], [Lev95]) are software\\nquality assurance activities (Chapter 16) that focus on the identification and assess-\\nment of potential hazards that may affect software negatively and cause an entire\\nsystem to fail. If hazards can be identified early in the software engineering process,\\nsoftware design features can be specified that will either eliminate or control poten-\\ntial hazards.\\n28.7 T HE RMMM P LAN\\nA risk management strategy can be included in the software project plan, or the risk\\nmanagement steps can be organized into a separate risk mitigation, monitoring, and\\nmanagement plan (RMMM). The RMMM plan documents all work performed as part\\nof risk analysis and is used by the project manager as part of the overall project\\nplan.\\nSome software teams do not develop a formal RMMM document. Rather, each\\nrisk is documented individually using a risk information sheet (RIS) [Wil97]. In most\\ncases, the RIS is maintained using a database system so that creation and informa-\\ntion entry, priority ordering, searches, and other analysis may be accomplished eas-\\nily. The format of the RIS is illustrated in Figure 28.4.\\nOnce RMMM has been documented and the project has begun, risk mitigation and\\nmonitoring steps commence. As I have already discussed, risk mitigation is a prob-\\nlem avoidance activity. Risk monitoring is a project tracking activity with three pri-\\nmary objectives: (1) to assess whether predicted risks do, in fact, occur; (2) to ensure\\nthat risk aversion steps defined for the risk are being properly applied; and (3) to col-\\nlect information that can be used for future risk analysis. In many cases, the prob-\\nlems that occur during a project can be traced to more than one risk. Another job of\\nrisk monitoring is to attempt to allocate origin [what risk(s) caused which problems\\nthroughout the project].\\nCHAPTER 28 RISK MANAGEMENT 757\\npre75977_ch28.qxd  11/27/08  6:30 PM  Page 757'),\n",

Royer (Project Risk Man-\\nagement, Management Concepts, 2002) and Smith and Merritt ( Proactive Risk Management,\\nProductivity Press, 2002) suggest a proactive process for risk management. Karolak ( Software\\nEngineering Risk Management, Wiley, 2002) has written a guidebook that introduces an easy-to-\\nuse risk analysis model with worthwhile checklists and questionnaires supported by a software\\npackage.\\nCapers Jones (Assessment and Control of Software Risks, Prentice Hall, 1994) presents a de-\\ntailed discussion of software risks that includes data collected from hundreds of software proj-\\nects. Jones defines 60 risk factors that can affect the outcome of software projects. Boehm\\n[Boe89] suggests excellent questionnaire and checklist formats that can prove invaluable in\\nidentifying risk. Charette [Cha89] presents a detailed treatment of the mechanics of risk analy-\\nsis, calling on probability theory and statistical techniques to analyze risks. In a companion vol-\\nume, Charette (Application Strategies for Risk Analysis, McGraw-Hill, 1990) discusses risk in the\\ncontext of both system and software engineering and suggests pragmatic strategies for risk\\nmanagement. Gilb (Principles of Software Engineering Management,Addison-Wesley, 1988) pres-\\nents a set of “principles” (which are often amusing and sometimes profound) that can serve as\\na worthwhile guide for risk management.\\nEwusi-Mensah (Software Development Failures: Anatomy of Abandoned Projects, MIT Press,\\n2003) and Yourdon (Death March, Prentice Hall, 1997) discuss what happens when risks over-\\nwhelm a software project team. Bernstein (Against the Gods, Wiley, 1998) presents an enter-\\ntaining history of risk that goes back to ancient times.\\nThe Software Engineering Institute has published many detailed reports and guidebooks on\\nrisk analysis and management. The Air Force Systems Command pamphlet AFSCP 800-45\\n[AFC88] describes risk identification and reduction techniques.

Before long, the queue has grown\\nlong and the work it implies threatens to overwhelm the available resources. As time\\npasses, your organization finds that it’s spending more money and time maintaining\\nexisting programs than it is engineering new applications. In fact, it’s not unusual for\\na software organization to expend as much as 60 to 70 percent of all resources on\\nsoftware maintenance.\\nYou may ask why so much maintenance is required and why so much effort is\\nexpended. Osborne and Chikofsky [Osb90] provide a partial answer:\\nMuch of the software we depend on today is on average 10 to 15 years old. Even when\\nthese programs were created using the best design and coding techniques known at the\\ntime [and most were not], they were created when program size and storage space were\\nprinciple concerns. They were then migrated to new platforms, adjusted for changes in\\nmachine and operating system technology and enhanced to meet new user needs—all\\nwithout enough regard to overall architecture. The result is the poorly designed struc-\\ntures, poor coding, poor logic, and poor documentation of the software systems we are\\nnow called on to keep running . . .\\nAnother reason for the software maintenance problem is the mobility of software\\npeople. It is likely that the software team (or person) that did the original work is no\\nlonger around. Worse, other generations of software people have modified the\\nsystem and moved on. And today, there may be no one left who has any direct\\nknowledge of the legacy system.\\nAs I noted in Chapter 22, the ubiquitous nature of change underlies all software\\nwork. Change is inevitable when computer-based systems are built; therefore, you\\nmust develop mechanisms for evaluating, controlling, and making modifications.\\nThroughout this book, I’ve emphasized the importance of understanding the\\nproblem (analysis) and developing a well-structured solution (design). In fact, Part 2\\nof the book is dedicated to the mechanics of these software engineering actions, and\\nPart 3 focuses on the techniques required to be sure you’ve done them correctly. Both\\nanalysis and design lead to an important software characteristic that we call main-\\ntainability. In essence, maintainability is a qualitative indication\\n1 of the ease with\\nwhich existing software can be corrected, adapted, or enhanced. Much of what soft-\\nware engineering is about is building systems that exhibit high maintainability.\\nBut what is maintainability? Maintainable software exhibits effective modularity\\n(Chapter 8). It makes use of design patterns (Chapter 12) that allow ease of under-\\nstanding. It has been constructed using well-defined coding standards and conven-\\ntions, leading to source code that is self-documenting and understandable. It has\\nundergone a variety of quality assurance techniques (Part 3 of this book) that have\\nuncovered potential maintenance problems before the software is released. It has\\nbeen created by software engineers who recognize that they may not be around\\nCHAPTER 29 MAINTENANCE AND REENGINEERING 763\\nuote:\\n“Program\\nmaintainability\\nand program\\nunderstandability\\nare parallel\\nconcepts: the more\\ndifficult a program\\nis to understand,\\nthe more difficult it\\nis to maintain.\\nGerald Berns\\n1 There are some quantitative measures that provide an indirect indication of maintainability (e.g.,\\n[Sch99], [SEI02]).\\npre75977_ch29.qxd  11/27/08  6:32 PM  Page 763'),\n",

Therefore, the design and implementation of the soft-\\nware must “assist” the person who is making the change.\\n29.2 S OFTWARE SUPPORTABILITY\\nIn order to effectively support industry-grade software, your organization (or its\\ndesignee) must be capable of making the corrections, adaptations, and enhance-\\nments that are part of the maintenance activity. But in addition, the organization\\nmust provide other important support activities that include ongoing operational\\nsupport, end-user support, and reengineering activities over the complete life cycle\\nof the software. A reasonable definition of software supportability is\\n. . . the capability of supporting a software system over its whole product life. This implies\\nsatisfying any necessary needs or requirements, but also the provision of equipment,\\nsupport infrastructure, additional software, facilities, manpower, or any other resource\\nrequired to maintain the software operational and capable of satisfying its function [SSO08].\\nIn essence, supportability is one of many quality factors that should be considered\\nduring the analysis and design actions that are part of the software process. It should\\nbe addressed as part of the requirements model (or specification) and considered as\\nthe design evolves and construction commences.\\nFor example, the need to “antibug” software at the component and code level has\\nbeen discussed earlier in the book. The software should contain facilities to assist\\nsupport personnel when a defect is encountered in the operational environment (and\\nmake no mistake, defects willbe encountered). In addition, support personnel should\\nhave access to a database that contains records of all defects that have already been\\nencountered—their characteristics, cause, and cure. This will enable support per-\\nsonnel to examine “similar” defects and may provide a means for more rapid diag-\\nnosis and correction.\\nAlthough defects encountered in an application are a critical support issue, sup-\\nportability also demands that resources be provided to support day-to-day end-user\\nissues.

During the 1990s, some companies made a legitimate effort to reengineer,\\nand the results led to improved competitiveness.

More important, how can we ensure that the\\n“radical change” suggested will in fact lead to “breakthrough results” instead of\\norganizational chaos?\\n29.4.1 Business Processes\\nA business process is “a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined\\nbusiness outcome” [Dav90]. Within the business process, people, equipment, mate-\\nrial resources, and business procedures are combined to produce a specified result.\\nExamples of business processes include designing a new product, purchasing serv-\\nices and supplies, hiring a new employee, and paying suppliers.

Every software organization should have an inventory of all\\napplications. The inventory can be nothing more than a spreadsheet model contain-\\ning information that provides a detailed description (e.g., size, age, business critical-\\nity) of every active application. By sorting this information according to business\\ncriticality, longevity, current maintainability and supportability, and other locally\\nimportant criteria, candidates for reengineering appear.

Weak documentation is the trademark of many legacy\\nsystems. But what can you do about it? What are your options?\\n1. Creating documentation is far too time consuming. If the system works, you\\nmay choose to live with what you have. In some cases, this is the correct\\napproach. It is not possible to re-create documentation for hundreds of com-\\nputer programs. If a program is relatively static, is coming to the end of its\\nuseful life, and is unlikely to undergo significant change, let it be!\\n2. Documentation must be updated, but your organization has limited resources.\\nYou’ll use a “document when touched” approach. It may not be necessary to\\nfully redocument an application. Rather, those portions of the system that are\\ncurrently undergoing change are fully documented. Over time, a collection of\\nuseful and relevant documentation will evolve.\\n3. The system is business critical and must be fully redocumented. Even in this\\ncase, an intelligent approach is to pare documentation to an essential\\nminimum.\\nEach of these options is viable. Your software organization must choose the one that\\nis most appropriate for each case.\\nReverse engineering. The term reverse engineering has its origins in the hardware\\nworld. A company disassembles a competitive hardware product in an effort to\\nunderstand its competitor’s design and manufacturing “secrets.” These secrets could\\nbe easily understood if the competitor’s design and manufacturing specifications\\nwere obtained.

In most cases, however, the pro-\\ngram to be reverse engineered is not a competitor’s. Rather, it is the company’s own\\nwork (often done many years earlier). The “secrets” to be understood are obscure\\nbecause no specification was ever developed. Therefore, reverse engineering for\\nsoftware is the process of analyzing a program in an effort to create a representation\\nof the program at a higher level of abstraction than source code. Reverse engineer-\\ning is a process of design recovery. Reverse engineering tools extract data, architec-\\ntural, and procedural design information from an existing program.\\nCode restructuring. The most common type of reengineering (actually, the use of\\nthe term reengineering is questionable in this case) is code restructuring.\\n4 Some\\nlegacy systems have a relatively solid program architecture, but individual modules\\nwere coded in a way that makes them difficult to understand, test, and maintain. In\\nsuch cases, the code within the suspect modules can be restructured.\\nTo accomplish this activity, the source code is analyzed using a restructuring\\ntool. Violations of structured programming constructs are noted and code is then\\nrestructured (this can be done automatically) or even rewritten in a more modern\\nprogramming language. The resultant restructured code is reviewed and tested to\\nensure that no anomalies have been introduced. Internal code documentation is\\nupdated.\\nData restructuring. A program with weak data architecture will be difficult to\\nadapt and enhance. In fact, for many applications, information architecture has more\\nto do with the long-term viability of a program than the source code itself.\\nUnlike code restructuring, which occurs at a relatively low level of abstraction,\\ndata restructuring is a full-scale reengineering activity. In most cases, data restruc-\\nturing begins with a reverse engineering activity. Current data architecture is dis-\\nsected, and necessary data models are defined (Chapters 6 and 9). Data objects and\\nattributes are identified, and existing data structures are reviewed for quality.\\nWhen data structure is weak (e.g., flat files are currently implemented, when a\\nrelational approach would greatly simplify processing), the data are reengineered.\\nBecause data architecture has a strong influence on program architecture and the\\nalgorithms that populate it, changes to the data will invariably result in either archi-\\ntectural or code-level changes.\\nForward engineering.

More important, these reengineer-\\ning tools are becoming increasingly more sophisticated.\\nForward engineering not only recovers design information from existing software\\nbut uses this information to alter or reconstitute the existing system in an effort to\\nimprove its overall quality. In most cases, reengineered software reimplements the\\nfunction of the existing system and also adds new functions and/or improves over-\\nall performance.\\n29.6 R EVERSE ENGINEERING\\nReverse engineering conjures an image of the “magic slot.” You feed a haphazardly\\ndesigned, undocumented source file into the slot and out the other end comes\\na complete design description (and full documentation) for the computer program.\\nUnfortunately, the magic slot doesn’t exist. Reverse engineering can extract design\\ninformation from source code, but the abstraction level, the completeness of the doc-\\numentation, the degree to which tools and a human analyst work together, and the\\ndirectionality of the process are highly variable.\\nThe abstraction level of a reverse engineering process and the tools used to effect\\nit refers to the sophistication of the design information that can be extracted from\\nsource code. Ideally, the abstraction level should be as high as possible. That is, the\\nreverse engineering process should be capable of deriving procedural design repre-\\nsentations (a low-level abstraction), program and data structure information\\n(a somewhat higher level of abstraction), object models, data and/or control flow\\nmodels (a relatively high level of abstraction), and entity relationship models (a high\\nlevel of abstraction). As the abstraction level increases, you are provided with infor-\\nmation that will allow easier understanding of the program.\\nThe completeness of a reverse engineering process refers to the level of detail that\\nis provided at an abstraction level. In most cases, the completeness decreases as the\\nabstraction level increases. For example, given a source code listing, it is relatively\\neasy to develop a complete procedural design representation. Simple architectural\\ndesign representations may also be derived, but it is far more difficult to develop a\\ncomplete set of UML diagrams or models.\\nCompleteness improves in direct proportion to the amount of analysis performed\\nby the person doing reverse engineering. Interactivity refers to the degree to which\\nthe human is “integrated” with automated tools to create an effective reverse engi-\\nneering process. In most cases, as the abstraction level increases, interactivity must\\nincrease or completeness will suffer.\\nIf the directionality of the reverse engineering process is one-way, all informa-\\ntion extracted from the source code is provided to the software engineer who can\\n772 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\npre75977_ch29.qxd  11/27/08  6:32 PM  Page 772'),\n",

Therefore, reengineering one database\\nschema into another requires an understanding of existing objects and their\\nrelationships.\\nThe following steps [Pre94] may be used to define the existing data model as a\\nprecursor to reengineering a new database model: (1) build an initial object model,\\n(2) determine candidate keys (the attributes are examined to determine whether\\nthey are used to point to another record or table; those that serve as pointers\\nbecome candidate keys), (3) refine the tentative classes, (4) define generalizations,\\nand (5) discover associations using techniques that are analogous to the CRC\\napproach. Once information defined in the preceding steps is known, a series of\\ntransformations [Pre94] can be applied to map the old database structure into a\\nnew database structure.\\n29.6.2 Reverse Engineering to Understand Processing\\nReverse engineering to understand processing begins with an attempt to understand\\nand then extract procedural abstractions represented by the source code. To under-\\nstand procedural abstractions, the code is analyzed at varying levels of abstraction:\\nsystem, program, component, pattern, and statement.\\nThe overall functionality of the entire application system must be understood be-\\nfore more detailed reverse engineering work occurs. This establishes a context for\\nfurther analysis and provides insight into interoperability issues among applications\\nwithin the system. Each of the programs that make up the application system repre-\\nsents a functional abstraction at a high level of detail. A block diagram, representing\\nthe interaction between these functional abstractions, is created. Each component\\nperforms some subfunction and represents a defined procedural abstraction. A pro-\\ncessing narrative for each component is developed. In some situations, system,\\nprogram, and component specifications already exist. When this is the case, the\\nspecifications are reviewed for conformance to existing code.\\n6\\n774 PART FOUR MANAGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS\\nThe approach to\\nreverse engineering for\\ndata for conventional\\nsoftware follows an\\nanalogous path:\\n(1) build a data\\nmodel, (2) identify\\nattributes of data\\nobjects, and (3) define\\nrelationships.\\nuote:\\n“There exists a\\npassion for\\ncomprehension,\\njust as there exists\\na passion for\\nmusic.

Therefore, the redevelopment of user interfaces has become one\\nof the most common types of reengineering activity. But before a user interface can\\nbe rebuilt, reverse engineering should occur.\\nTo fully understand an existing user interface, the structure and behavior of the\\ninterface must be specified. Merlo and his colleagues [Mer93] suggest three basic\\nquestions that must be answered as reverse engineering of the UI commences:\\n• What are the basic actions (e.g., keystrokes and mouse clicks) that the\\ninterface must process?\\n• What is a compact description of the behavioral response of the system to\\nthese actions?\\n• What is meant by a “replacement,” or more precisely, what concept of equiv-\\nalence of interfaces is relevant here?\\nBehavioral modeling notation (Chapter 7) can provide a means for developing\\nanswers to the first two questions. Much of the information necessary to create a\\nbehavioral model can be obtained by observing the external manifestation of the\\nexisting interface. But additional information necessary to create the behavioral\\nmodel must be extracted from the code.\\nIt is important to note that a replacement GUI may not mirror the old interface\\nexactly (in fact, it may be radically different). It is often worthwhile to develop a\\nnew interaction metaphor. For example, an old UI requests that a user provide\\na scale factor (ranging from 1 to 10) to shrink or magnify a graphical image. A\\nreengineered GUI might use a slide-bar and mouse to accomplish the same\\nfunction.\\nCHAPTER 29 MAINTENANCE AND REENGINEERING 775\\nHow do I\\nunderstand\\nthe workings of\\nan existing user\\ninterface?\\n?\\npre75977_ch29.qxd  11/27/08  6:32 PM  Page 775'),\n",

In essence, cen-\\ntralized computing resources (including software) are distributed among many client\\nplatforms. Although a variety of different distributed environments can be designed,\\nthe typical mainframe application that is reengineered into a client-server architec-\\nture has the following features:\\n• Application functionality migrates to each client computer.\\n• New GUI interfaces are implemented at the client sites.\\n• Database functions are allocated to the server.\\n• Specialized functionality (e.g., compute-intensive analysis) may remain at the\\nserver site.\\n• New communications, security, archiving, and control requirements must be\\nestablished at both the client and server sites.\\nIt is important to note that the migration from mainframe to client-server computing\\nrequires both business and software reengineering. In addition, an “enterprise network\\ninfrastructure” [Jay94] should be established.\\nReengineering for client-server applications begins with a thorough analysis of\\nthe business environment that encompasses the existing mainframe. Three layers of\\nabstraction can be identified. The database sits at the foundation of a client-server\\narchitecture and manages transactions and queries from server applications. Yet\\nthese transactions and queries must be controlled within the context of a set of busi-\\nness rules (defined by an existing or reengineered business process). Client applica-\\ntions provide targeted functionality to the user community.\\nThe functions of the existing database management system and the data archi-\\ntecture of the existing database must be reverse engineered as a precursor to the re-\\ndesign of the database foundation layer. In some cases a new data model (Chapter 6)\\nis created. In every case, the client-server database is reengineered to ensure that\\ntransactions are executed in a consistent manner, that all updates are performed\\nonly by authorized users, that core business rules are enforced (e.g., before a vendor\\nrecord is deleted, the server ensures that no related accounts payable, contracts, or\\nCHAPTER 29 MAINTENANCE AND REENGINEERING 779\\nIn some cases,\\nmigration to a client-\\nserver architecture\\nshould be approached\\nnot as reengineering,\\nbut as a new develop-\\nment effort.

But what about existing applications that\\nwere developed using conventional methods? In some cases, the answer is to leave\\nsuch applications “as is.” In others, older applications must be reengineered so that\\nthey can be easily integrated into large, object-oriented systems.\\nReengineering conventional software into an object-oriented implementation\\nuses many of the same techniques discussed in Part 2 of this book. First, the existing\\nsoftware is reverse engineered so that appropriate data, functional, and behavioral\\nmodels can be created. If the reengineered system extends the functionality or\\nbehavior of the original application, use cases (Chapters 5 and 6) are created. The\\ndata models created during reverse engineering are then used in conjunction with\\nCRC modeling (Chapter 6) to establish the basis for the definition of classes. Class\\nhierarchies, object-relationship models, object-behavior models, and subsystems\\nare defined, and object-oriented design commences.\\nAs object-oriented forward engineering progresses from analysis to design, a CBSE\\nprocess model (Chapter 10) can be invoked. If the existing application resides within a\\ndomain that is already populated by many object-oriented applications, it is likely that\\na robust component library exists and can be used during forward engineering.\\nFor those classes that must be engineered from scratch, it may be possible to\\nreuse algorithms and data structures from the existing conventional application.\\nHowever, these must be redesigned to conform to the object-oriented architecture.\\n29.9 T HE ECONOMICS OF REENGINEERING\\nIn a perfect world, every unmaintainable program would be retired immediately, to\\nbe replaced by high-quality, reengineered applications developed using modern soft-\\nware engineering practices.

Among recent additions to the literature are books\\nby Jarzabek (Effective Software Maintenance and Evolution, Auerbach, 2007), Grubb and Takang\\n(Software Maintenance: Concepts and Practice, World Scientific Publishing Co., 2d ed., 2003), and\\nPigoski (Practical Software Maintenance,Wiley, 1996). These books cover basic maintenance and\\nsupport practices and present useful management guidance. Maintenance techniques that focus\\non client-server environments are discussed by Schneberger ( Client/Server Software Mainte-\\nnance, McGraw-Hill, 1997). Current research in “software evolution” is presented in an anthol-\\nogy edited by Mens and Demeyer (Software Evolution, Springer, 2008).\\nLike many hot topics in the business community, the hype surrounding business process\\nreengineering has given way to a more pragmatic view of the subject. Hammer and Champy\\n(Reengineering the Corporation, HarperBusiness, revised edition, 2003) precipitated early inter-\\nest with their best-selling book. Other books by Smith and Fingar [Business Process Management\\n(BPM): The Third Wave, Meghan-Kiffer Press, 2003], Jacka and Keller (Business Process Mapping:\\nImproving Customer Satisfaction,Wiley, 2001), Sharp and McDermott (Workflow Modeling,Artech\\nHouse, 2001), Andersen (Business Process Improvement Toolbox, American Society for Quality,\\n1999), and Harrington et al. (Business Process Improvement Workbook,McGraw-Hill, 1997) pres-\\nent case studies and detailed guidelines for BPR.\\nFong (Information Systems Reengineering and Integration,Springer, 2006) describes database\\nconversion techniques, reverse engineering, and forward engineering as they are applied for\\nmajor information systems. Demeyer and his colleagues (Object Oriented Reengineering Patterns,\\nMorgan Kaufmann, 2002) provides a patterns-based view of how to refactor and/or reengineer\\nOO systems. Secord and his colleagues (Modernizing Legacy Systems, Addison-Wesley, 2003),\\nUlrich (Legacy Systems: Transformation Strategies, Prentice Hall, 2002), Valenti (Successful Soft-\\nware Reengineering, IRM Press, 2002), and Rada (Reengineering Software: How to Reuse Pro-\\ngramming to Build New, State-of-the-Art Software, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1999) focus on\\nstrategies and practices for reengineering at a technical level. Miller (Reengineering Legacy Soft-\\nware Systems, Digital Press, 1998) “provides a framework for keeping application systems syn-\\nchronized with business strategies and technology changes.”\\nCameron (Reengineering Business for Success in the Internet Age, Computer Technology\\nResearch, 2000) and Umar [Application (Re)Engineering: Building Web-Based Applications and\\nDealing with Legacies, Prentice Hall, 1997] provide worthwhile guidance for organizations that\\nwant to transform legacy systems into a Web-based environment. Cook (Building Enterprise\\nInformation Architectures: Reengineering Information Systems, Prentice Hall, 1996) discusses the\\nbridge between BPR and information technology. Aiken (Data Reverse Engineering,McGraw-Hill,\\n1996) discusses how to reclaim, reorganize, and reuse organizational data. Arnold (Software\\nReengineering, IEEE Computer Society Press, 1993) has put together an excellent anthology of\\nearly papers that focus on software reengineering technologies.\\nA wide variety of information sources on software reengineering is available on the Internet.\\nAn up-to-date list of World Wide Web references  relevant to software maintenance and reengi-\\nneering can be found at the SEPA website: www.mhhe.com/engcs/compsci/pressman/\\nprofessional/olc/ser.htm.\\nCHAPTER 29 MAINTENANCE AND REENGINEERING 783\\npre75977_ch29.qxd  11/27/08  6:32 PM  Page 783'),\n",

The job is difficult and rarely goes as\\nsmoothly as one might like—but when it succeeds, the results are profound. Software\\nprojects are more likely to be completed on time. Communication between all con-\\nstituencies involved in software development is improved. The level of confusion and\\nchaos that is often prevalent for large software projects is reduced substantially. The\\nnumber of errors encountered by the customer drops substantially. The credibility of the\\nsoftware organization increases. And management has one less problem to worry about.\\nBut all is not sweetness and light. Many companies attempt to implement software\\nengineering practice and give up in frustration. Others do it half-way and never see\\nthe benefits noted above. Still others do it in a heavy-handed fashion that results in\\nopen rebellion among technical staff and managers and subsequent loss of morale.\\n786\\nCHAPTER\\n30\\nSOFTWARE PROCESS\\nIMPROVEMENT\\nKEY\\nCONCEPTS\\nassessment  . . .791\\nCMMI  . . . . . . .797\\ncritical success\\nfactors  . . . . . . .796\\neducation and\\ntraining  . . . . . .793\\nevaluation  . . . .795\\ninstallation/\\nmigration  . . . . .794\\njustification  . . .793\\nmaturity \\nmodels . . . . . . .789\\npeople CMM . . .801\\nreturn on\\ninvestment . . . .804\\nrisk \\nmanagement  . .795\\nWhat is it?

Others have\\nestablished a “mature” software process that guides their technical and project man-\\nagement activities. But others continue to struggle. Their practices are hit-and-miss,\\nand their process is ad hoc. Occasionally, their work is spectacular, but in the main,\\neach project is an adventure, and no one knows whether it will end badly or well.\\nSo, which of these two cohorts needs software process improvement? The\\nanswer (which may surprise you) is both.Those that have succeeded in making soft-\\nware engineering happen cannot become complacent. They must work continually\\nto improve their approach to software engineering. And those that struggle must\\nbegin their journey down the road toward improvement.\\n30.1 W HAT IS SPI?\\nThe term software process improvement(SPI) implies many things. First, it implies that\\nelements of an effective software process can be defined in an effective manner;\\nsecond, that an existing organizational approach to software development can be\\nassessed against those elements; and third, that a meaningful strategy for improve-\\nment can be defined. The SPI strategy transforms the existing approach to software\\ndevelopment into something that is more focused, more repeatable, and more reli-\\nable (in terms of the quality of the product produced and the timeliness of delivery).\\nBecause SPI is not free, it must deliver a return on investment. The effort and time\\nthat is required to implement an SPI strategy must pay for itself in some measura-\\nble way. To do this, the results of improved process and practice must lead to a\\nreduction in software “problems” that cost time and money. It must reduce the num-\\nber of defects that are delivered to end users, reduce the amount of rework due to\\nquality problems, reduce the costs associated with software maintenance and\\nsupport (Chapter 29), and reduce the indirect costs that occur when software is\\ndelivered late.\\n30.1.1 Approaches to SPI\\nAlthough an organization can choose a relatively informal approach to SPI, the vast\\nmajority choose one of a number of SPI frameworks. An SPI frameworkdefines (1) a\\nset of characteristics that must be present if an effective software process is to be\\nachieved, (2) a method for assessing whether those characteristics are present, (3) a\\nmechanism for summarizing the results of any assessment, and (4) a strategy for\\nassisting a software organization in implementing those process characteristics that\\nhave been found to be weak or missing.\\nselection  . . . . .793\\nsoftware process\\nimprovement \\n(SPI)  . . . . . . . .787\\napplicability  . .790\\nframeworks  . .787\\nprocess  . . . . .791\\nSPI implies a defined\\nsoftware process, an\\norganizational\\napproach, and a\\nstrategy for\\nimprovement.\\nuote:\\n“Much of the\\nsoftware crisis is\\nself-inflicted, as\\nwhen a CIO says,\\n‘I’d rather have it\\nwrong than have\\nit late.

The intent of the\\nmaturity model is to provide an overall indication of the “process maturity” exhibited\\nby a software organization. That is, an indication of the quality of the software\\nprocess, the degree to which practitioner’s understand and apply the process, and\\nthe general state of software engineering practice. This is accomplished using some\\ntype of ordinal scale.\\nFor example, the Software Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity Model\\n(Section 30.4) suggests five levels of maturity [Sch96]:\\nLevel 5, Optimized—The organization has quantitative feedback systems in place to\\nidentify process weaknesses and strengthen them pro-actively. Project teams analyze\\ndefects to determine their causes; software processes are evaluated and updated to pre-\\nvent known types of defects from recurring.\\nLevel 4, Managed—Detailed software process and product quality metrics establish\\nthe quantitative evaluation foundation. Meaningful variations in process performance\\ncan be distinguished from random noise, and trends in process and product qualities can\\nbe predicted.\\nLevel 3, Defined—Processes for management and engineering are documented,\\nstandardized, and integrated into a standard software process for the organization.\\nCHAPTER 30 SOFTWARE PROCESS IMPROVEMENT 789\\nA maturity model\\ndefines levels of\\nsoftware process\\ncompetence and\\nimplementation.\\n“What are\\nthe different\\nconstituencies that\\nsupport SPI?”\\n?\\npre75977_ch30.qxd  11/27/08  6:33 PM  Page 789'),\n",

Schorsch [Sch06] suggests\\nfour levels of immaturity that are often encountered in the real world of software\\ndevelopment organizations:\\nLevel 0, Negligent—Failure to allow successful development process to succeed. All prob-\\nlems are perceived to be technical problems. Managerial and quality assurance activities\\nare deemed to be overhead and superfluous to the task of software development process.\\nReliance on silver pellets.\\nLevel –1, Obstructive—Counterproductive processes are imposed. Processes are rigidly\\ndefined and adherence to the form is stressed. Ritualistic ceremonies abound. Collective\\nmanagement precludes assigning responsibility. Status quo über alles.\\nLevel –2, Contemptuous—Disregard for good software engineering institutionalized.\\nComplete schism between software development activities and software process\\nimprovement activities. Complete lack of a training program.\\nLevel –3, Undermining—Total neglect of own charter, conscious discrediting of peer\\norganization’s software process improvement efforts. Rewarding failure and poor\\nperformance.\\nSchorsch’s immaturity levels are toxic for any software organization. If you\\nencounter any one of them, attempts at SPI are doomed to failure.\\nThe overriding question is whether maturity scales, such as the one proposed as part\\nof the CMM, provide any real benefit. I think that they do. A maturity scale provides an\\neasily understood snapshot of process quality that can be used by practitioners and\\nmanagers as a benchmark from which improvement strategies can be planned.\\n30.1.3 Is SPI for Everyone?\\nFor many years, SPI was viewed as a “corporate” activity—a euphemism for some-\\nthing that only large companies perform. But today, a significant percentage of\\nall software development is being performed by companies that employ fewer than\\n100 people. Can a small company initiate SPI activities and do it successfully?\\nThere are substantial cultural differences between large software development\\norganizations and small ones. It should come as no surprise that small organizations\\nare more informal, apply fewer standard practices, and tend to be self-organizing.\\nThey also tend to pride themselves on the “creativity” of individual members of the\\n790 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\nIf a specific process\\nmodel or SPI approach\\nfeels like overkill for\\nyour organization, it\\nprobably is.\\n“How do you\\nrecognize an\\norganization that\\nwill resist SPI\\nefforts?”\\n?\\npre75977_ch30.qxd  11/27/08  6:33 PM  Page 790'),\n",

Managers must allocate people and money to\\nmake software engineering happen. Therefore, regardless of the size of the software\\norganization, it’s reasonable to consider the business motivation for SPI.\\nSPI will be approved and implemented only after its proponents demonstrate\\nfinancial leverage [Bir98]. Financial leverage is demonstrated by examining tech-\\nnical benefits (e.g., fewer defects delivered to the field, reduced rework, lower\\nmaintenance costs, or more rapid time-to-market) and translating them into\\ndollars. In essence, you must show a realistic return on investment (Section 30.7)\\nfor SPI costs.\\n30.2 T HE SPI P ROCESS\\nThe hard part of SPI isn’t the definition of characteristics that define a high-quality\\nsoftware process or the creation of a process maturity model. Those things are rela-\\ntively easy. Rather, the hard part is establishing a consensus for initiating SPI and\\ndefining an ongoing strategy for implementing it across a software organization.\\nThe Software Engineering Institute has developed IDEAL—“an organizational\\nimprovement model that serves as a roadmap for initiating, planning, and imple-\\nmenting improvement actions” [SEI08]. IDEAL is representative of many process\\nmodels for SPI, defining five distinct activities—initiating, diagnosing, establishing,\\nacting, and learning—that guide an organization through SPI activities.\\nIn this book, I present a somewhat different road map for SPI, based on the\\nprocess model for SPI originally proposed in [Pre88]. It applies a commonsense phi-\\nlosophy that requires an organization to (1) look in the mirror, (2) then get smarter\\nso it can make intelligent choices, (3) select the process model (and related technol-\\nogy elements) that best meets its needs, (4) instantiate the model into its operating\\nenvironment and its culture, and (5) evaluate what has been done. These five activ-\\nities (discussed in the subsections\\n2 that follow) are applied in an iterative (cyclical)\\nmanner in an effort to foster continuous process improvement.\\n30.2.1 Assessment and Gap Analysis\\nAny attempt to improve your current software process without first assessing the\\nefficacy of current framework activities and associated software engineering prac-\\ntices would be like starting on a long journey to a new location with no idea where\\nyou are starting from.

It follows that a key element of any SPI strategy is education and train-\\ning for practitioners, technical managers and more senior managers who have direct\\ncontact with the software organization. Three types of education and training should\\nbe conducted:\\nGeneric concepts and methods. Directed toward both managers and\\npractitioners, this category stresses both process and practice. The intent is\\nto provide professionals with the intellectual tools they need to apply the\\nsoftware process effectively and to make rational decisions about improve-\\nments to the process.\\nSpecific technology and tools. Directed primarily toward practitioners,\\nthis category stresses technologies and tools that have been adopted for local\\nuse. For example, if UML has been chosen for analysis and design modeling, a\\ntraining curriculum for software engineering using UML would be established.\\nBusiness communication and quality-related topics. Directed toward\\nall stakeholders, this category focuses on “soft” topics that help enable better\\ncommunication among stakeholders and foster a greater quality focus.\\nIn a modern context, education and training can be delivered in a variety of dif-\\nferent ways. Everything from podcasts, to Internet-based training (e.g., [QAI08]), to\\nDVDs, to classroom courses can be offered as part of an SPI strategy.\\n30.2.3 Selection and Justification\\nOnce the initial assessment activity4 has been completed and education has begun, a\\nsoftware organization should begin to make choices. These choices occur during a\\nselection and justification activityin which process characteristics and specific software\\nengineering methods and tools are chosen to populate the software process.\\nFirst, you should choose the process model (Chapters 2 and 3) that best fits your\\norganization, its stakeholders, and the software that you build.

You should also con-\\nsider the software engineering methods that can be applied to achieve these tasks.\\nAs choices are made, education and training should be coordinated to ensure that\\nunderstanding is reinforced.\\nIdeally, everyone works together to select various process and technology\\nelements and moves smoothly toward the installation or migration activity (Sec-\\ntion 30.2.4). In reality, selection can be a rocky road. It is often difficult to achieve\\nconsensus among different constituencies. If the criteria for selection are established\\nby committee, people may argue endlessly about whether the criteria are appropri-\\nate and whether a choice truly meets the criteria that have been established.\\nIt is true that a bad choice can do more harm than good, but “paralysis by analysis”\\nmeans that little if any progress occurs and process problems remain. As long as the\\nprocess characteristic or technology element has a good chance at meeting an\\norganization’s needs, it’s sometimes better to pull the trigger and make a choice,\\nrather than waiting for the optimal solution.\\nOnce a choice is made, time and money must be expended to instantiate it\\nwithin an organization, and these resource expenditures should be justified. A\\ndiscussion of cost justification and return on investment for SPI is presented in\\nSection 30.7.\\n30.2.4 Installation/Migration\\nInstallation is the first point at which a software organization feels the effects of\\nchanges implemented as a consequence of the SPI road map. In some cases, an\\nentirely new process is recommended for an organization. Framework activities,\\nsoftware engineering actions, and individual work tasks must be defined and\\ninstalled as part of a new software engineering culture. Such changes represent a\\nsubstantial organizational and technological transition and must be managed\\nvery carefully.\\nIn other cases, changes associated with SPI are relatively minor, representing\\nsmall, but meaningful modifications to an existing process model. Such changes are\\noften referred to as process migration. Today, many software organizations have a\\n“process” in place. The problem is that it doesn’t work in an effective manner. There-\\nfore, an incremental migration from one process (that doesn’t work as well as\\ndesired) to another process is a more effective strategy.\\nInstallation and migration are actually software process redesign (SPR) activities.\\nScacchi [Sca00] states that “SPR is concerned with identification, application, and\\n794 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\npre75977_ch30.qxd  11/27/08  6:33 PM  Page 794'),\n",

If the target process is significantly dif-\\nferent from the existing process, the only rational approach to installation is an in-\\ncremental strategy in which the transitional process is implemented in steps. The\\ntransitional process provides a series of way-points that enable the software organi-\\nzation’s culture to adapt to small changes over a period of time.\\n30.2.5 Evaluation\\nAlthough it is listed as the last activity in the SPI road map, evaluation occurs\\nthroughout SPI. The evaluation activity assesses the degree to which changes have\\nbeen instantiated and adopted, the degree to which such changes result in better\\nsoftware quality or other tangible process benefits, and the overall status of the\\nprocess and the organizational culture as SPI activities proceed.\\nBoth qualitative factors and quantitative metrics are considered during the eval-\\nuation activity. From a qualitative point of view, past management and practitioner\\nattitudes about the software process can be compared to attitudes polled after in-\\nstallation of process changes. Quantitative metrics (Chapter 25) are collected from\\nprojects that have used the transitional or “to be” process and compared with sim-\\nilar metrics that were collected for projects that were conducted under the “as is”\\nprocess.\\n30.2.6 Risk Management for SPI\\nSPI is a risky undertaking. In fact, more than half of all SPI efforts end in failure. The\\nreasons for failure vary greatly and are organizationally specific. Among the most\\ncommon risks are: a lack of management support, cultural resistance by technical\\nstaff, a poorly planned SPI strategy, an overly formal approach to SPI, selection of an\\ninappropriate process, a lack of buy-in by key stakeholders, an inadequate budget, a\\nlack of staff training, organizational instability, and a myriad of other factors. The\\nrole of those chartered with the responsibility for SPI is to analyze likely risks and\\ndevelop an internal strategy for mitigating them.\\nA software organization should manage risk at three key points in the SPI process\\n[Sta97b]: prior to the initiation of the SPI road map, during the execution of SPI\\nactivities (assessment, education, selection, installation), and during the evaluation\\nactivity that follows the instantiation of some process characteristic. In general, the\\nfollowing categories [Sta97b] can be identified for SPI risk factors: budget and cost,\\ncontent and deliverables, culture, maintenance of SPI deliverables, mission and\\ngoals, organizational management, organizational stability, process stakeholders,\\nschedule for SPI development, SPI development environment, SPI development\\nprocess, SPI project management, and SPI staff.\\nCHAPTER 30 SOFTWARE PROCESS IMPROVEMENT 795\\nSPI often fails because\\nrisks were not properly\\nconsidered and no\\ncontingency planning\\noccurred.\\npre75977_ch30.qxd  11/27/08  6:33 PM  Page 795'),\n",

Organizational risks,\\npeople risks, and project management risks present challenges for those who lead\\nany SPI effort. Although risk management is important, it’s equally important to\\nrecognize those critical factors that lead to success.\\nAfter examining 56 software organizations and their SPI efforts, Stelzer and Mellis\\n[Ste99] identify a set of critical success factors (CSFs) that must be present if SPI is to\\nsucceed. The top five CSFs are presented in this section.\\nManagement commitment and support.Like most activities that precipi-\\ntate organizational and cultural change, SPI will succeed only if management\\nis actively involved. Senior business managers should recognize the impor-\\ntance of software to their company and be active sponsors of the SPI effort.\\nTechnical managers should be heavily involved in the development of the local\\nSPI strategy. As the authors of the study note: “Software process improvement\\nis not feasible without investing time, money, and effort” [Ste99]. Management\\ncommitment and support are essential to sustain that investment.\\n796 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\n5 Risk factors for each of the risk categories noted in this section can be found in [Sta97b].\\nWhat critical\\nsuccess\\nfactors are crucial\\nfor successful\\nSPI?\\n?\\npre75977_ch30.qxd  11/27/08  6:33 PM  Page 796'),\n",

The continuous CMMI meta-\\nmodel describes a process in two dimensions as illustrated in Figure 30.2. Each\\nprocess area (e.g., project planning or requirements management) is formally\\nassessed against specific goals and practices and is rated according to the follow-\\ning capability levels:\\nLevel 0: Incomplete—the process area (e.g., requirements management) is\\neither not performed or does not achieve all goals and objectives defined by\\nthe CMMI for level 1 capability for the process area.\\nLevel 1: Performed—all of the specific goals of the process area (as defined\\nby the CMMI) have been satisfied.

It defines\\n(in 700+ pages) the process characteristics\\nthat should exist if an organization wants to establish a\\nsoftware process that is complete. The question that has\\nbeen debated for well over a decade is: “Is the CMMI\\noverkill?” Like most things in life (and in software), the\\nanswer is not a simple “yes” or “no.”\\nThe spirit of the CMMI should always be adopted.\\nAt the risk of oversimplification, it argues that software\\ndevelopment must be taken seriously—it must be planned\\nthoroughly, it must be controlled uniformly, it must be\\ntracked accurately, and it must be conducted professionally.\\nIt must focus on the needs of project stakeholders, the skills\\nof the software engineers, and the quality of the end\\nproduct. No one would argue with these ideas.\\nThe detailed requirements of the CMMI should be\\nseriously considered if an organization builds large\\ncomplex systems that involve dozens or hundreds of\\npeople over many months or years. It may be that\\nthe CMMI is “just right” in such situations, if the\\norganizational culture is amenable to standard process\\nmodels and management is committed to making it a\\nsuccess. However, in other situations, the CMMI may\\nsimply be too much for an organization to successfully\\nassimilate. Does this mean that the CMMI is “bad” or\\n“overly bureaucratic” or “old fashioned?” No ...i t\\ndoes not. It simply means that what is right for one\\norganizational culture may not be right for another.\\nThe CMMI is a significant achievement in software\\nengineering. It provides a comprehensive discussion of the\\nactivities and actions that should be present when an\\norganization builds computer software.

If you have further interest, a wide array of print and Web-based resources is\\navailable for each.\\nSPICE. The SPICE (Software Process Improvement and Capability dEtermination )\\nmodel provides an SPI assessment framework that is compliant with ISO 15504:2003\\nand ISO 12207. The SPICE document suite [SDS08] presents a complete SPI frame-\\nwork including a model for process management, guidelines for conducting an\\nassessment and rating the process under consideration, construction, selection, and\\nuse of assessment instruments and tools, and training for assessors.\\nBootstrap. The Bootstrap SPI framework “has been developed to ensure confor-\\nmance with the emerging ISO standard for software process assessment and im-\\nprovement (SPICE) and to align the methodology with ISO 12207” [Boo06]. The\\nobjective of Bootstrap is to evaluate a software process using a set of software engi-\\nneering best practices as a basis for assessment. Like the CMMI, Bootstrap provides\\na process maturity level using the results of questionnaires that gather information\\nabout the “as is” software process and software projects. SPI guidelines are based on\\nmaturity level and organizational goals.\\nPSP and TSP. Although SPI is generally characterized as an organizational\\nactivity, there is no reason why process improvement cannot be conducted at an\\nindividual or team level. Both PSP and TSP (Chapter 2) emphasize the need to con-\\ntinuously collect data about the work that is being performed and to use that data\\nto develop strategies for improvement. Watts Humphrey [Hum97], the developer of\\nboth methods, comments:\\nThe PSP [and TSP] will show you how to plan and track your work and how to consis-\\ntently produce high quality software. Using PSP [and TSP] will give you the data that show\\nthe effectiveness of your work and identify your strengths and weaknesses. ...T o  have\\na successful and rewarding career, you need to know your skills and abilities, strive to\\nimprove them, and capitalize on your unique talents in the work you do.\\nTickIT. The Ticket auditing method ensures compliance with ISO 9001:2000 for\\nSoftware—a generic standard that applies to any organization that wants to improve\\nthe overall quality of the products, systems, or services that it provides. Therefore,\\nthe standard is directly applicable to software organizations and companies.\\nCHAPTER 30 SOFTWARE PROCESS IMPROVEMENT 803\\nIn addition\\nto the CMM,\\nare there other\\nSPI frameworks\\nthat we might\\nconsider?\\n?\\nuote:\\n“Software\\norganizations have\\nexhibited\\nsignificant\\nshortcomings in\\ntheir ability to\\ncapitalize on the\\nexperiences gained\\nfrom completed\\nprojects.”\\nNASA\\npre75977_ch30.qxd  11/27/08  6:33 PM  Page 803'),\n",

Within a software context, “plan”\\nestablishes the process objectives, activities, and tasks necessary to achieve high-\\nquality software and resultant customer satisfaction. “Do” implements the software\\nprocess (including both framework and umbrella activities). “Check” monitors and\\nmeasures the process to ensure that all requirements established for quality man-\\nagement have been achieved. “Act” initiates software process improvement activi-\\nties that continually work to improve the process.

But that doesn’t mean that\\na software organization should conduct an SPI program without careful analysis of\\nthe costs and benefits that accrue. A comprehensive treatment of ROI for SPI can be\\nfound in a unique book by David Rico [Ric04].\\n30.7 SPI T RENDS\\nOver the past two decades, many companies have attempted to improve their soft-\\nware engineering practices by applying an SPI framework to effect organizational\\nchange and technology transition. As I noted earlier in this chapter, over half fail in\\nthis endeavor. Regardless of success or failure, all spend significant amounts of\\nmoney. David Rico [Ric04] reports that a typical application of an SPI framework such\\nas the SEI CMM can cost between $25,000 and $70,000 per person and take years to\\ncomplete! It should come as no surprise that the future of SPI should emphasize a\\nless costly and time-consuming approach.\\nTo be effective in the twenty-first century world of software development, future\\nSPI frameworks must become significantly more agile. Rather than an organizational\\nfocus (which can take years to complete successfully), contemporary SPI efforts\\nshould focus on the project level, working to improve a team process in weeks, not\\nmonths or years. To achieve meaningful results (even at the project level) in a short\\ntime frame, complex framework models may give way to simpler models. Rather\\nthan dozens of key practices and hundreds of supplementary practices, an agile SPI\\nframework should emphasize only a few pivotal practices (e.g., analogous to the\\nframework activities discussed throughout this book).\\nAny attempt at SPI demands a knowledgeable workforce, but education and train-\\ning expenses can be expensive and should be minimized (and streamlined). Rather\\nthan classroom courses (expensive and time consuming), future SPI efforts should\\nrely on Web-based training that is targeted at pivotal practices. Rather than far-\\nreaching attempts to change organizational culture (with all of the political perils\\nthat ensue), cultural change should occur as it does in the real world, one small\\ngroup at a time until a tipping point is reached.\\nThe SPI work of the past two decades has significant merit. The frameworks and\\nmodels that have been developed represent substantial intellectual assets for the\\nsoftware engineering community. But like all things, these assets guide future\\nattempts at SPI not by becoming a recurring dogma, but by serving as the basis for\\nbetter, simpler, and more agile SPI models.\\nCHAPTER 30 SOFTWARE PROCESS IMPROVEMENT 805\\npre75977_ch30.qxd  11/27/08  6:33 PM  Page 805'),\n",

As\\na consequence of assessment, a software organization can develop an overall SPI plan.\\nOne of the key elements of any SPI plan is education and training, an activity that\\nfocuses on improving the knowledge level of managers and practitioners. Once staff\\nbecomes well versed in current software technologies, selection and justification com-\\nmence. These tasks lead to choices about the architecture of the software process, the\\nmethods that populate it, and the tools that support it. Installation and evaluation are\\nSPI activities that instantiate process changes and assess their efficacy and impact.\\nTo successfully improve its software process, an organization must exhibit the fol-\\nlowing characteristics: management commitment and support for SPI, staff involve-\\nment throughout the SPI process, process integration into the overall organizational\\nculture, an SPI strategy that has been customized for local needs, and solid man-\\nagement of the SPI project.\\nA number of SPI frameworks are in use today.

But other (“harder”) research-\\nand technology-oriented trends remain important. Research trends “are driven by\\ngeneral perceptions of the state of the art and the state of the practice, by researcher\\nperceptions of practitioner needs, by national funding programs that rally around\\nspecific strategic goals, and by sheer technical interest” [Mil00a].

Today, it is not\\nuncommon for small digital devices to encompass between 60,000 to 200,000 lines\\nof custom software, coupled with a few million LOC for operating system features.\\nModern computer-based systems containing 10 to 50 million lines of code are not\\nuncommon.\\n4 In the relatively near future, systems5 requiring over 1 billion LOC will\\nbegin to emerge.6\\nThink about that for a moment!\\nConsider the interfaces for a billion LOC system, both to the outside world, to\\nother interoperable systems, to the Internet (or its successor), and to the millions of\\ninternal components that must all work together to make this computing monster\\noperate successfully. Is there a reliable way to ensure that all of these connections\\nwill allow information to flow properly?\\nConsider the project itself. How do we manage the workflow and track progress?\\nWill conventional approaches scale upward by orders of magnitude?\\nConsider the number of people (and their locations) who will be doing the work,\\nthe coordination of people and technology, the unrelenting flow of changes, the like-\\nlihood of a multiplatform, multioperating system environment. Is there a way to\\nmanage and coordinate people who are working on a monster project?\\nConsider the engineering challenge. How can we analyze tens of thousands of\\nrequirements, constraints, and restrictions in a way that ensures that inconsistency\\nand ambiguity, omissions, and outright errors are uncovered and corrected? How\\ncan we create a design architecture that is robust enough to handle a system of this\\nsize? How can software engineers establish a change management system that will\\nhave to handle hundreds of thousands of changes?\\nConsider the challenge of quality assurance. How can we perform verification and\\nvalidation in a meaningful way? How do you test a 1 billion LOC system?\\n814 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\n4 For example, modern PC operating systems (e.g., Linux, MacOS, and Windows) have between 30\\nand 60 million LOC. Operating system software for mobile devices can exceed 2 million LOC.\\n5 In reality, this “system” will actually be a system of systems—hundreds of interoperable applica-\\ntions working together to achieve some overall objective.\\n6 Not all complex systems are large.

Ducatel [Duc01] defines\\namI in the following way: “People are surrounded by intelligent, intuitive interfaces\\nthat are embedded in all kinds of objects. The ambient intelligence environment is\\ncapable of recognizing and responding to the presence of different individuals [while\\nworking] in a seamless, unobstrusive way.”\\nLet’s examine a vision of the near future in which amI has become ubiquitous.\\nYou’ve just purchased a personal communicator (called a P-com, a pocket-sized mo-\\nbile device) and have spent the last few weeks creating\\n8 your “image”—everything\\nfrom your daily schedule, to-do list, address book, medical records, business-related\\ninformation, travel documents, wish list (things you’re looking for, e.g., a specific\\nbook, a bottle of hard-to-find wine, a local course in glass blowing), and “Digital-Me”\\n(D-Me) that describes you at a level of detail that allows a digital introduction to oth-\\ners (sort of a MySpace or FaceBook that moves with you). The P-com contains a per-\\nsonal identifier called a “key of keys”—a multifunctional personal identifier that would\\nprovide access to and enable queries from a wide range of amI devices and systems.\\nIt should be obvious that significant privacy and security issues come into play. A\\n“trust management system” [Duc01] will be an integral part of amI and will manage\\nprivileges that enable communication with networks, health, entertainment, finan-\\ncial, employment, and personal systems.\\nNew amI-capable systems will be added to the network constantly, each provid-\\ning useful capabilities and demanding access to your P-com. Therefore, the P-com\\nsoftware must be designed so that it can adapt to the requirements that emerge\\nas some new amI systems go online. There are many ways to accomplish this, but\\nthe bottom line is this: the P-com software must be flexible and robust in ways that\\nconventional software can’t match.\\nCHAPTER 31 EMERGING TRENDS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 815\\n7 A worthwhile and quite detailed introduction to ambient intelligence can be found at\\nwww.emergingcommunication.com/volume6.html.

It also means that software engineers\\ncannot always foresee where ambiguities and inconsistencies lie. Requirements\\nchange—but that’s nothing new.\\nAs systems become more complex, it follows that even a rudimentary attempt to\\nstate comprehensive requirements is doomed to failure. A statement of overall goals\\nmay be possible, delineation of intermediate objectives can be accomplished, but\\nstable requirements—not a chance! Requirements will emerge as everyone involved\\nin the engineering and construction of a complex system learns more about it, the\\nenvironment in which it is to reside, and the users who will interact with it.\\nThis reality implies a number of software engineering trends. First, process mod-\\nels must be designed to embrace change and adopt the basic tenets of the agile phi-\\nlosophy (Chapter 3). Next, methods that yield engineering models (e.g., requirements\\nand design models) must be used judiciously because those models will change\\nrepeatedly as more knowledge about the system is acquired. Finally, tools that\\nsupport both process and methods must make adaptation and change easy.\\nBut there is another aspect to emergent requirements. The vast majority of soft-\\nware developed to date assumes that the boundary between the software-based\\nsystem and its external environment is stable. The boundary may change, but it will\\ndo so in a controlled manner, allowing the software to be adapted as part of a regular\\nsoftware maintenance cycle. This assumption is beginning to change. Open-world\\nsoftware (Section 31.2.2) demands that computer-based systems “adapt and react to\\nchanges dynamically, even if they’re unanticipated” [Bar06].\\nBy their nature, emergent requirements lead to change. How do we control the\\nevolution of a widely used application or system over its lifetime, and what effect\\ndoes this have on the way we design software?\\nAs the number of changes grows, the likelihood of unintended side effects also\\ngrows. This should be a cause for concern as complex systems with emergent\\nrequirements become the norm. The software engineering community must develop\\nmethods that help software teams predict the impact of change across an entire sys-\\ntem, thereby mitigating unintended side effects. Today, our ability to accomplish this\\nis severely limited.\\n31.3.4 The Talent Mix\\nAs software-based systems become more complex, as communication and collabo-\\nration among global teams becomes commonplace, as emergent requirements (with\\nthe resultant flow of changes) become the norm, the very nature of a software engi-\\nneering team may change. Each software team must bring a variety of creative tal-\\nent and technical skills to its part of a complex system, and the overall process must\\nallow the output of these islands of talent to merge effectively.\\n816 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\nBecause emergent\\nrequirements are\\nalready a reality, your\\norganization should\\nconsider adopting an\\nincremental process\\nmodel.\\npre75977_ch31.qxd  11/27/08  6:35 PM  Page 816'),\n",

Although the software engineering community has made progress\\nas it attempts to capture past knowledge and reuse proven solutions, a significant\\npercentage of the software that is built today continues to be built “from scratch.”\\nPart of the reason for this is a continuing desire (by stakeholders and software engi-\\nneering practitioners) for “unique solutions.”\\nIn the hardware world, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of digital\\ndevices use application-specific standard products (ASSPs) produced by silicon\\nvendors almost exclusively. This “merchant hardware” provides the building blocks\\nnecessary to implement everything from a mobile phone to an HD-DVD player.\\nIncreasingly, the same OEMs are using “merchant software”—software building\\nblocks designed specifically for a unique application domain [e.g., VoIP devices].\\nMichael Ward [War07] comments:\\nOne advantage of the use of software components is that the OEM can leverage the func-\\ntionality provided by the software without having to develop in-house expertise in the\\nspecific functions or invest developer time on the effort to implement and validate the\\ncomponents. Other advantages include the ability to acquire and deploy only the specific\\nset of functionalities that are needed for the system, as well as the ability to integrate\\nthese components into an already-existing architecture.\\nHowever, the software component approach does have a disadvantage in that there\\nis a given level of effort required to integrate the individual components into the overall\\nproduct. This integration challenge may be further complicated if the components are\\nsourced from a variety of vendors, each with its own interface methodologies. As addi-\\ntional sources of components are used, the effort required to manage various vendors in-\\ncreases, and there is a greater risk of encountering problems related to the interaction\\nacross components from different sources.\\nIn addition to components packaged as merchant software, there is an increasing\\ntendency to adopt software platform solutions that “incorporate collections of related\\nCHAPTER 31 EMERGING TRENDS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 817\\nuote:\\n“The proper artistic\\nresponse to digital\\ntechnology is to\\nembrace it as a\\nnew window on\\neverything that’s\\neternally human,\\nand to use it with\\npassion, wisdom,\\nfearlessness\\nand joy.”\\nRalph\\nLombreglia\\npre75977_ch31.qxd  11/27/08  6:35 PM  Page 817'),\n",

Increasingly, the answer is\\n“everyone.” The “open source” movement has been described in the following man-\\nner [OSO08]: “Open source is a development method for software that harnesses the\\npower of distributed peer review and transparency of process. The promise of open\\nsource is better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end to\\npredatory vendor lock-in.” The term open sourcewhen applied to computer software,\\nimplies that software engineering work products (models, source code, test suites)\\nare open to the public and can be reviewed and extended (with controls) by anyone\\nwith interest and permission.\\nAn open-source “team” may have a number of full-time “dream team” members\\n(Section 31.3.4), but the number of people working on the software expands and\\ncontracts as interest in the application strengthens or weakens. The power of the\\nopen-source team is derived from constant peer review and design/code refactor-\\ning that results in a slow progression toward an optimal solution.\\nIf you have further interest, Weber [Web05] provides a worthwhile introduction,\\nand Feller and his colleagues [Fel07] have edited a comprehensive and objective\\nanthology that considers the benefits and problems associated with open source.\\n818 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\nTechnologies to Watch\\nMany emerging technologies are likely to have\\na significant impact on the types of computer-\\nbased systems that evolve.

It’s only when\\na “tipping point” [Gla02] is reached, that a technology cascades across the software\\nengineering community and broad-based change truly does occur.\\nIn this section I’ll examine a few trends in process, methods, and tools that are\\nlikely to have some influence on software engineering over the next decade. Will\\nthey lead to a tipping point? We’ll just have to wait and see.\\n31.4.1 Process Trends\\nIt can be argued that all of the business, organizational, and cultural trends discussed\\nin Section 31.3 reinforce the need for process. But do the frameworks discussed in\\nChapter 30 provide a road map into the future? Will process frameworks evolve to\\nfind a better balance between discipline and creativity? Will the software process\\nadapt to the differing needs of stakeholders who procure software, those who build\\nit, and those who use it? Can it provide a means for reducing risk for all three con-\\nstituencies at the same time?\\nThese and many other questions remain open. However, some trends are begin-\\nning to emerge. Conradi and Fuggetta [Con02] suggest six “theses on how to\\nCHAPTER 31 EMERGING TRENDS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 819\\nexample encompassing over 4.5 million computers,\\nvisit http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/.\\nOpen-world computing—“It’s ambient, implicit,\\ninvisible, and adaptive.

Cognitive machines are still in the early stages\\nof development, but the potential is enormous.\\nOLED displays—an OLED “uses a carbon-based\\ndesigner molecule that emits light when an electric\\ncurrent passes through it.

A\\nsoftware company’s goal is to survive and grow in a competitive market. An end user’s\\ngoal is to acquire the software product that can solve the right problem, at the right time,\\nat an acceptable price. We cannot expect the same SPI approach and consequent effort\\nto accommodate all these viewpoints.\\nIn the paragraphs that follow, I have adapted the theses proposed by Conradi and\\nFuggetta [Con02] to suggest possible process trends over the next decade.\\n1. As SPI frameworks evolve, they will emphasize “strategies that focus on goal\\norientation and product innovation” [Con02]. In the fast-paced world of soft-\\nware development, long-term SPI strategies rarely survive in a dynamic\\nbusiness environment. Too much changes too quickly. This means that a\\nstable, step-by-step road map for SPI may have to be replaced with a\\nframework that emphasizes short-term goals that have a product orienta-\\ntion. If the requirements for a new software-based product line will emerge\\nover a series of incremental product releases (to be delivered to end users\\nvia the Web) the software organization may recognize the need to improve\\nits ability to manage change. Process improvements associated with\\nchange management must be coordinated with the release cycle of the\\nproduct in a way that will improve change management while at the same\\ntime not being disruptive.\\n2. Because software engineers have a good sense of where the process is weak,\\nprocess changes should generally be driven by their needs and should start form\\nthe bottom up. Conradi and Fuggetta [Con02] suggest that future SPI activities\\nshould “use a simple and focused scorecard to start with, not a large assess-\\nment.” By focusing SPI efforts narrowly and working from the bottom up,\\npractitioners will begin to see substantive changes early—changes that make\\na real difference in the way that software engineering work is conducted.\\n3. Automated software process technology (SPT) will move away from global\\nprocess management (broad-based support of the entire software process)\\nto focus on those aspects of the software process that can best benefit from\\nautomation. No one is against tools and automation, but in many instances,\\nSPT has not met its promise (see Section 31.2). To be most effective, it\\nshould focus on umbrella activities (Chapter 2)—the most stable elements\\nof the software process.\\n4. Greater emphasis will be placed on the return on investment of SPI activities.

As time passes, the software community may come to understand that expertise\\nin sociology and anthropology may have as much or more to do with successful\\nSPI as other, more technical disciplines.Above all else, SPI changes organiza-\\ntional culture, and cultural change involves individuals and groups of people.\\nConradi and Fuggetta [Con02] correctly note that “software developers are\\nknowledge workers. They tend to respond negatively to top-level dictates on\\nhow to do work or change processes.” Much can be learned by examining the\\nsociology of groups to better understand effective ways to introduce change.\\n6. New modes of learning may facilitate the transition to a more effective software\\nprocess. In this context, “learning” implies learning from successes and mis-\\ntakes. A software organization that collects metrics (Chapters 23 and 25)\\nallows itself to understand how elements of a process affect the quality of the\\nend product.\\n31.4.2 The Grand Challenge\\nThere is one trend that is undeniable—software-based systems will undoubtedly\\nbecome bigger and more complex as time passes. It is the engineering of these large,\\ncomplex systems, regardless of delivery platform or application domain, that poses\\nthe “grand challenge” [Bro06] for software engineers. Manfred Broy [Bro06] suggests\\nthat software engineers can meet “the daunting challenge of complex software\\nsystems development” by creating new approaches to understanding system mod-\\nels and using those models as a basis for the construction of high-quality next-\\ngeneration software.\\nAs the software engineering community develops new model-driven approaches\\n(discussed later in this section) to the representation of system requirements and\\ndesign, the following characteristics [Bro06] must be addressed:\\n• Multifunctionality—as digital devices evolve into their second and third gener-\\nation, they have begun to deliver a rich set of sometimes unrelated functions.\\nThe mobile phone, once considered a communication device, is now used\\nfor taking photos, keeping a calendar, navigating a journey, and as a music\\nplayer. If open-world interfaces come to pass, these mobile devices will be\\nused for much more over the coming years. As Broy [Bro06] notes,\\n“engineers must describe the detailed context in which the functions will be\\ndelivered and, most important, must identify the potentially harmful interac-\\ntions between the system’s different features.”\\n• Reactivity and timeliness—digital devices increasingly interact with the real\\nworld and must react to external stimuli in a timely manner.

Even more complex systems are on the immediate horizon,\\npresenting significant challenges for software designers.\\n• Heterogeneous, distributed systems—the real-time components of any modern\\nembedded system can be connected via an internal bus, a wireless network,\\nor across the Internet (or all three).\\n• Criticality—software has become the pivotal component in virtually all\\nbusiness-critical systems and in most safety-critical systems. Yet, the\\nsoftware engineering community has only begun to apply even the most\\nbasic principles of software safety.\\n• Maintenance variability—the life of software within a digital device rarely lasts\\nbeyond 3 to 5 years, but the complex avionics systems within an aircraft has\\na useful life of at least 20 years.

Should this have an impact on design?\\nBroy [Bro06] argues that these and other software characteristics can be managed\\nonly if the software engineering community develops a more effective distributed\\nand collaborative software engineering philosophy, better requirements engineering\\napproaches, a more robust approach to model-driven development, and better soft-\\nware tools.

The success or\\nfailure of these actions has a very strong influence on the success or failure of the\\nentire software engineering process. And yet, requirements engineering (RE) has\\nbeen compared to “trying to put a hose clamp around jello” [Gon04]. As I’ve noted in\\nmany places throughout this book, software requirements have a tendency to keep\\nchanging, and with the advent of open-world systems, emergent requirements (and\\nnear-continuous change) may become the norm.\\nToday, most “informal” requirements engineering approaches begin with the cre-\\nation of user scenarios (e.g., use cases). More formal approaches create one or more\\nrequirements models and use these as a basis for design. Formal methods enable a\\nsoftware engineer to represent requirements using a verifiable mathematical nota-\\ntion. All can work reasonably well when requirements are stable, but do not readily\\nsolve the problem of dynamic or emergent requirements.\\nThere are a number of distinct requirements engineering research directions\\nincluding natural language processing from translated textual descriptions into more\\nstructured representations (e.g., analysis classes), greater reliance on databases for\\nstructuring and understanding software requirements, the use of RE patterns to\\ndescribe typical problems and solutions when requirements engineering tasks are\\nconducted, and goal-oriented requirements engineering. However, at the industry\\nlevel, RE actions remain relatively informal and surprisingly basic. To improve the\\nmanner in which requirements are defined, the software engineering community will\\nlikely implement three distinct subprocesses as RE is conducted [Gli07]: (1) improved\\nknowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing that allows more complete under-\\nstanding of application domain constraints and stakeholder needs, (2) greater empha-\\nsis on iteration as requirements are defined, and (3) more effective communication\\nand coordination tools that enable all stakeholders to collaborate effectively.\\nThe RE subprocesses noted in the preceding paragraph will only succeed if they\\nare properly integrated into an evolving approach to software engineering. As\\npattern-based problem solving and component-based solutions begin to dominate\\nmany application domains, RE must accommodate the desire for agility (rapid\\n824 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\n“New RE subprocesses\\ninclude: (1) improved\\nknowledge acquisition,\\n(2) even more\\niteration, and\\n(3) more effective\\ncommunication and\\ncoordination tools.”\\npre75977_ch31.qxd  12/3/08  1:56 PM  Page 824'),\n",

The con-\\ncurrent nature of many software engineering process models means that RE will be\\nintegrated with design and construction activities. As a consequence, the notion of\\na static “software specification” is beginning to disappear, to be replaced by “value-\\ndriven requirements” [Som05] derived as stakeholders respond to features and func-\\ntions delivered in early software increments.\\n31.4.5 Model-Driven Software Development\\nSoftware engineers grapple with abstraction at virtually every step in the software\\nengineering process. As design commences, architectural and component-level\\nabstractions are represented and assessed. They must then be translated into a pro-\\ngramming language representation that transforms the design (a relatively high level\\nof abstraction) into an operable system with a specific computing environment\\n(a low level of abstraction). Model-driven software development\\n11 couples domain-\\nspecific modeling languages with transformation engines and generators in a way\\nthat facilitates the representation of abstraction at high levels and then transforms it\\ninto lower levels [Sch06].\\nDomain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) represent “application structure,\\nbehavior and requirements within particular application domains” and are described\\nwith meta-models that “define the relationships among concepts in the domain and\\nprecisely specify the key semantics and constraints associated with these domain\\nconcepts” [Sch06]. The key difference between a DSML and a general-purpose mod-\\neling language such as UML (Appendix 1) is that the DSML is tuned to design con-\\ncepts inherent in the application domain and can therefore represent relationships\\nand constraints among design elements in an efficient manner.\\n31.4.6 Postmodern Design\\nIn an interesting article on software design in the “postmodern era,” Philippe\\nKruchten [Kru05] makes the following observation:\\nComputer science hasn’t achieved the grand narrative that explains it all, the big picture—\\nwe haven’t found the fundamental laws of software that would play the role that the fun-\\ndamental laws of physics play in other engineering disciplines. We still live with the bitter\\naftertaste of the Internet bubble burst and the Y2K doomsday. So, in this postmodern era,\\nwhere it seems that everything matters a bit yet not much really matters, what are the\\nnext directions for software design?\\nPart of any attempt to understand trends in software design is to establish bound-\\naries for design.

Similarly, as the design of software components moves\\ncloser to algorithmic detail, a designer begins to represent the component at a level\\nof abstraction that is close to code.\\nPostmodern design will continue to emphasize the importance of software archi-\\ntecture (Chapter 9). A designer must state an architectural issue, make a decision\\nthat addresses the issue, and then clearly define the assumptions, constraints, and\\nimplications that the decision places on the software as a whole. But is there a frame-\\nwork in which the issues can be described and the architecture can be defined?\\nAspect-oriented software development (Chapter 2) or model-driven software devel-\\nopment (Section 31.4.4) may become important design approaches in the years\\nahead, but it’s still too soon to tell. It may be that breakthroughs in component-based\\ndevelopment (Chapter 10) may lead to a design philosophy that emphasizes the as-\\nsembly of existing components. If the past is prologue, it’s highly likely that many\\n“new” design methods will emerge, but few will ride the hype curve (Figure 31.2)\\nmuch beyond the “trough of disillusionment.”\\n31.4.7 Test-Driven Development\\nRequirements drive design, and design establishes a foundation for construction.\\nThis simple software engineering reality works reasonably well and is essential as a\\nsoftware architecture is created. However, a subtle change can provide significant\\nbenefit when component-level design and construction are considered.\\nIn test-driven development (TDD), requirements for a software component serve as\\nthe basis for the creation of a series of test cases that exercise the interface and\\nattempt to find errors in the data structures and functionality delivered by the com-\\nponent. TDD is not really a new technology but rather a trend that emphasizes the\\ndesign of test cases before the creation of source code.\\n12\\nThe TDD process follows the simple procedural flow illustrated in Figure 31.3.\\nBefore the first small segment of code is created, a software engineer creates a test\\nto exercise the code (to try to make the code fail). The code is then written to satisfy\\nthe test. If it passes, a new test is created for the next segment of code to be devel-\\noped. The process continues until the component is fully coded and all tests execute\\nwithout error. However, if any test succeeds in finding an error, the existing code is\\nrefactored (corrected) and all tests created to that point are reexecuted. This itera-\\ntive flow continues until there are no tests left to be created, implying that the com-\\nponent meets all requirements defined for it.\\nDuring TDD, code is developed in very small increments (one subfunction at a\\ntime), and no code is written until a test exists to exercise it. You should note that\\neach iteration results in one or more new tests that are added to a regression test\\nsuite that is run with every change. This is done to ensure that the new code has not\\ngenerated side effects that cause errors in the older code.\\n826 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\n12 Recall that Extreme Programming (Chapter 3) emphasizes this approach as part of its agile process\\nmodel.\\n“TDD is a trend that\\nemphasizes the design\\nof test cases before\\nthe creation of\\nsource code.”\\npre75977_ch31.qxd  12/3/08  1:56 PM  Page 826'),\n",

In the sections that follow, I’ll examine each path briefly.\\n31.5.1 Tools That Respond to Soft Trends\\nThe soft trends discussed in Section 31.3—the need to manage complexity, accom-\\nmodate emergent requirements, establish process models that embrace change,\\ncoordinate global teams with a changing talent mix, among others—suggest a new\\nera in which tools support for stakeholder collaboration will become as important as\\ntools support for technology. But what kind of tool set supports these soft trends?\\nOne example of research in this area is GENESIS—a generalized, open-source\\nenvironment designed to support collaborative software engineering work [Ave04].\\nThe GENESIS environment may or may not gain widespread usage, but its basic\\nelements are representative of the direction of collaborative SEEs that will evolve to\\nsupport the soft trends noted in this chapter.\\nA collaborative SEE “supports co-operation and communication among software\\nengineers belonging to distributed development teams involved in modeling, control-\\nling, and measuring software development and maintenance processes. Moreover, it\\nincludes an artifact management function that stores and manages software artifacts\\n(work products) produced by different teams in the course of their work” [Bol02].\\nFigure 31.4 illustrates an architecture for a collaborative SEE. The architecture,\\nbased on the GENESIS environment [Ave04], is constructed of subsystems that are\\nintegrated within a common Web client and is complemented by server-based\\ncomponents that provide support for all clients. Each development organization\\nhas its own client-side subsystems that communicate to other clients. Referring to\\nFigure 31.4, a resource management subsystem manages the allocation of human\\nresources to different projects or subprojects; a work product management system is\\n“responsible for the creation, modification, deletion,” indexing, searching, and stor-\\nage of all software engineering work products [Ave04]; a workflow management\\nsubsystem coordinates the definition, instantiation, and implementation of software\\nprocess activities, actions, and tasks; anevent engine“collects events” that occur dur-\\ning the software process (e.g., a successful review of a work product, the completion\\nof unit testing of a component) and notifies others; a communication systemsupports\\nboth synchronous and asynchronous communication among the distributed teams.\\n828 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\npre75977_ch31.qxd  11/27/08  6:35 PM  Page 828'),\n",

Therefore, the trend toward collaborative SEEs (Section 31.5.1) will provide\\nbenefits even when software is developed locally. But what of the technology tools\\nthat complement the system and components that empower better collaboration?\\nOne of the dominant trends in technology tools is the creation of a tool set\\nthat supports model-driven development (Section 31.4.4) with an emphasis on\\narchitecture-driven design. Oren Novotny [Nov04] suggests that the model rather\\nthan the source code becomes the central software engineering focus:\\nPlatform independent models are created in UML and then undergo various levels of\\ntransformation to eventually wind up as source code for a specific platform. It stands to\\nreason then, that the model, not the file, should become the new unit of output. A model\\nhas many different views at different levels of abstraction. At the highest level, platform\\nindependent components can be specified in analysis; at the lowest level there is a plat-\\nform specific implementation that reduces to a set of classes in code.\\nNovotny argues that a new generation of tools will work in conjunction with a repos-\\nitory to create models at all necessary levels of abstraction, establish relationships\\nbetween the various models, translate models at one level of abstraction to another\\nlevel (e.g., translate a design model into source code), manage changes and versions,\\nand coordinate quality control and assurance actions against the software models.\\nIn addition to complete software engineering environments, point-solution tools\\nthat address everything from requirements gathering to design/code refactoring to\\ntesting will continue to evolve and become more functionally capable. In some in-\\nstances, modeling and testing tools targeted at a specific application domain will\\nprovide enhanced benefit when compared to their generic equivalents.\\n31.6 S UMMARY\\nThe trends that have an effect on software engineering technology often come from\\nthe business, organizational, market, and cultural arenas. These “soft trends” can\\nguide the direction of research and the technology that is derived as a consequence\\nof research.\\nAs a new technology is introduced, it moves through a life cycle that does not\\nalways lead to widespread adoption, even though original expectations are high. The\\ndegree to which any software engineering technology gains widespread adoption is\\ntied to its ability to address the problems posed by both soft and hard trends.\\nSoft trends—the growing need for connectivity and collaboration, global projects,\\nknowledge transfer, the impact of emerging economies, and the influence of human\\nculture itself, lead to a set of challenges that span managing complexity and emergent\\n830 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\npre75977_ch31.qxd  11/27/08  6:35 PM  Page 830'),\n",

I have argued that measurement, discipline, and an\\noverriding focus on agility and quality will result in software that meets the cus-\\ntomer’s needs, software that is reliable, software that is maintainable, software\\nthat is better. Yet, I have never promised that software engineering is a panacea.\\nAs we move into the second decade of this new century, software and systems\\ntechnologies remain a challenge for every software professional and every com-\\npany that builds computer-based systems. Although he wrote these words with a\\ntwentieth century outlook, Max Hopper [Hop90] accurately describes the current\\nstate of affairs:\\nBecause changes in information technology are becoming so rapid and unforgiving,\\nand the consequences of falling behind are so irreversible, companies will either mas-\\nter the technology or die. . . . Think of it as a technology treadmill. Companies will have\\nto run harder and harder just to stay in place.\\nChanges in software engineering technology are indeed ”rapid and unforgiving,”\\nbut at the same time progress is often quite slow. By the time a decision is made\\nto adopt a new process, method, or tool; conduct the training necessary to\\nunderstand its application; and introduce the technology into the software devel-\\nopment culture, something newer (and even better) has come along, and the\\nprocess begins anew.\\nWhat is it?

I discussed a few of those in\\nChapter 31.\\nIn this concluding chapter I’ll take a broader view and consider where we’ve been\\nand where we’re going from a more philosophical perspective.\\n32.1 T HE IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE —R EVISITED\\nThe importance of computer software can be stated in many ways. In Chapter 1, soft-\\nware was characterized as a differentiator. The function delivered by software dif-\\nferentiates products, systems, and services and provides competitive advantage in\\nthe marketplace. But software is more than a differentiator. When taken as a whole,\\nsoftware engineering work products generate the most important commodity that\\nany individual, business, or government can acquire—information.\\nIn Chapter 31, I briefly discussed open-world computing—ambient intelligence,\\ncontext-aware applications, and pervasive/ubiquitous computing—a direction that\\nwill fundamentally change our perception of computers, the things that we do with\\nthem (and they do for us), and our perception of information as a guide, a com-\\nmodity, and a necessity. I also noted that software required to support open-world\\ncomputing will present dramatic new challenges for software engineers. But far\\nmore important, the coming pervasiveness of computer software will present even\\nmore dramatic challenges for society as a whole. Whenever a technology has a\\nbroad impact—an impact that can save lives or endanger them, build businesses or\\ndestroy them, inform government leaders or mislead them—it must be “handled\\nwith care.”\\n32.2 P EOPLE AND THE WAY THEY BUILD SYSTEMS\\nThe software required for high-technology systems becomes more and more com-\\nplex with each passing year, and the size of resultant programs increases propor-\\ntionally. The rapid growth in the size of the “average” program would present us with\\nfew problems if it wasn’t for one simple fact: As program size increases, the number\\nof people who must work on the program must also increase.\\nExperience indicates that as the number of people on a software project team\\nincreases, the overall productivity of the group may suffer. One way around this\\nproblem is to create a number of software engineering teams, thereby compart-\\nmentalizing people into individual working groups. However, as the number of\\nsoftware engineering teams grows, communication between them becomes as\\ndifficult and time consuming as communication between individuals.

In Chapter 31, I\\ndiscussed collaborative environments that may provide dramatic improvements in\\nthe ways teams communicate.\\nIn the final analysis, communication is the transfer of knowledge, and the acqui-\\nsition (and transfer) of knowledge is changing in profound ways. As search engines\\nbecome increasingly sophisticated and Web 2.0 applications provide better synergy,\\nthe world’s largest library of research papers and reports, tutorials, commentary, and\\nreferences becomes readily accessible and usable.\\nIf past history is any indication, it is fair to say that people themselves will not\\nchange. However, the ways in which they communicate, the environment in which\\nthey work, the manner in which they acquire knowledge, the methods and tools that\\nthey use, the discipline that they apply, and therefore, the overall culture for software\\ndevelopment will change in significant and even profound ways.\\n32.3 N EW MODES FOR REPRESENTING INFORMATION\\nOver the history of computing, a subtle transition has occurred in the terminology\\nthat is used to describe software development work performed for the business com-\\nmunity. Forty years ago, the term data processing was the operative phrase for de-\\nscribing the use of computers in a business context. Today, data processing has given\\nway to another phrase—information technology—that implies the same thing but\\npresents a subtle shift in focus. The emphasis is not merely to process large quanti-\\nties of data but rather to extract meaningful information from this data. Obviously,\\nthis was always the intent, but the shift in terminology reflects a far more important\\nshift in management philosophy.\\nWhen software applications are discussed today, the words data, information, and\\ncontent occur repeatedly. We encounter the word knowledge in some artificial intel-\\nligence applications, but its use is relatively rare. Virtually no one discusses wisdom\\nin the context of software applications.\\nData is raw information—collections of facts that must be processed to be mean-\\ningful. Information is derived by associating facts within a given context. Knowledge\\nassociates information obtained in one context with other information obtained in\\na different context. Finally, wisdom occurs when generalized principles are derived\\nfrom disparate knowledge. Each of these four views of “information” is represented\\nschematically in Figure 32.1.\\nTo date, the vast majority of all software has been built to process data or infor-\\nmation.

In addition, gen-Xers began their childbearing years. The\\ncensus data can then be connected to other seemingly unrelated pieces of informa-\\ntion. For example, the current number of elementary school teachers who will retire\\nduring the next decade, the number of college students graduating with degrees in\\nprimary and secondary education, the pressure on politicians to hold down taxes and\\ntherefore limit pay increases for teachers. All of these pieces of information can be\\ncombined to formulate a representation of knowledge—there will be significant\\npressure on the education system in the United States in the early twenty-first cen-\\ntury, and this pressure will continue for a number of decades.

One of the most significant challenges facing the soft-\\nware engineering community is to build systems that take the next step along the\\nspectrum—systems that extract knowledge from data and information in a way that\\nis practical and beneficial.\\n32.4 T HE LONG VIEW\\nIn Section 32.3, I suggested that the road ahead leads to systems that “process\\nknowledge.” But the future of computing in general and software-based systems in\\nparticular may lead to events that are considerably more profound.\\nIn a fascinating book that is must reading for every person involved in computing\\ntechnologies, Ray Kurzweil [Kur05] suggests that we have reached a time when “the\\npace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will\\nbe irreversibly transformed.” Kurzweil\\n3 makes a compelling argument that we are\\ncurrently at the “knee” of an exponential growth curve that will lead to enormous in-\\ncreases in computing capacity over the next two decades. When coupled with equiv-\\nalent advances in nanotechnology, genetics, and robotics, we may approach a time\\nin the middle part of this century when the distinction between humans (as we know\\nthem today) and machines begins to blur—a time when human evolution accelerates\\nin ways that are both frightening (to some) and spectacular (to others).\\nBy sometime in the 2030s, Kurzweil argues that computing capacity and the req-\\nuisite software will be sufficient to model every aspect of the human brain—all of the\\nphysical connections, analog processes, and chemical overlays. When this occurs,\\nhuman beings will have achieved “strong AI (artificial intelligence),” and as a conse-\\nquence, machines that truly do think (using today’s conventional use of the word).\\nBut there will be a fundamental difference. Human brain processes are exceedingly\\ncomplex and only loosely connected to external informal sources. They are also\\ncomputationally slow, even in comparison to today’s computing technology. When\\nfull human brain emulation occurs, “thought” will occur at speeds thousands of\\ntimes more rapid than its human counterpart with intimate connections to a sea of\\ninformation (think of the present-day Web as a primitive example). The result is . . .\\nwell . . . so fantastical that it’s best left to Kurzweil to describe.\\nIt’s important to note that not everyone believes that the future Kurzweil describes\\nis a good thing. In a now famous essay entitled “The Future Doesn’t Need Us,” Bill\\nJoy [Joy00], one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, argues that “robotics, genetic\\nCHAPTER 32 CONCLUDING COMMENTS 837\\n3 It’s important to note that Kurzweil is not a run-of-the mill science fiction writer or a futurist with-\\nout portfolio.

As pro-\\nfessionals, software engineers should abide by a code of ethics that guides the work\\nthat they do and the products that they produce. An ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Task Force\\nhas produced a Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practices\\n(Version 5.1). The code [ACM98] states:\\nSoftware engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification,\\ndesign, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected\\nprofession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the\\npublic, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:\\n1. PUBLIC—Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.\\n2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER—Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best\\ninterests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.\\n3. PRODUCT—Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifica-\\ntions meet the highest professional standards possible.\\n4. JUDGMENT—Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their\\nprofessional judgment.\\n5. MANAGEMENT—Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and\\npromote an ethical approach to the management of software development and main-\\ntenance.\\n6. PROFESSION—Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the\\nprofession consistent with the public interest.\\n7. COLLEAGUES—Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.\\n8. SELF—Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice\\nof their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the\\nprofession.\\nAlthough each of these eight principles is equally important, an overriding theme\\nappears: a software engineer should work in the public interest. On a personal level,\\na software engineer should abide by the following rules:\\n• Never steal data for personal gain.\\n• Never distribute or sell proprietary information obtained as part of your work\\non a software project.\\n838 PART FIVE ADVANCED TOPICS\\nWebRef\\nA complete discussion\\nof the ACM/IEEE\\ncode of ethics\\ncan be found at\\nseeri.etsu.edu/\\nCodes/default\\n.shtm.\\npre75977_ch32.qxd  11/27/08  6:35 PM  Page 838'),\n",

Although debate continues on the “right paradigm,” the impor-\\ntance of agility, the degree of automation, and the most effective methods, the\\nunderlying principles of software engineering are now accepted throughout the\\nindustry. Why, then, have we seen their broad adoption only recently?\\nThe answer, I think, lies in the difficulty of technology transition and the cultural\\nchange that accompanies it.

UML\\nmerged a number of competing modeling notations that were in use by the soft-\\nware industry at the time. In 1997, UML 1.0 was submitted to the Object Manage-\\nment Group, a nonprofit consortium involved in maintaining specifications for\\nuse by the computer industry. UML 1.0 was revised to UML 1.1 and adopted later\\nthat year. The current standard is UML 2.0 and is now an ISO standard. Because\\nthis standard is so new, many older references, such as [Gam95] do not use UML\\nnotation.\\nUML 2.0 provides 13 different diagrams for use in software modeling.

The\\nUML language provides these (sometimes arcane) options so that you can\\nexpress all the important aspects of a system. At the same time, you have\\nthe flexibility to suppress those parts of the diagram that are not relevant to the\\naspect being modeled in order to avoid cluttering the diagram with irrelevant\\ndetails. Therefore, the omission of a particular feature does not mean that the\\nfeature is absent; it may mean that the feature was suppressed.

It does not show the dynamic nature of\\nthe communications between the objects of the classes in the diagram.\\nThe main elements of a class diagram are boxes, which are the icons used to rep-\\nresent classes and interfaces. Each box is divided into horizontal parts. The top part\\ncontains the name of the class. The middle section lists the attributes of the class. An\\nattribute refers to something that an object of that class knows or can provide all the\\ntime. Attributes are usually implemented as fields of the class, but they need not be.\\nThey could be values that the class can compute from its instance variables or val-\\nues that the class can get from other objects of which it is composed. For example,\\nan object might always know the current time and be able to return it to you when-\\never you ask. Therefore, it would be appropriate to list the current time as an\\nattribute of that class of objects. However, the object would most likely not have that\\ntime stored in one of its instance variables, because it would need to continually\\nupdate that field. Instead, the object would likely compute the current time (e.g.,\\nthrough consultation with objects of other classes) at the moment when the time is\\nrequested. The third section of the class diagram contains the operations or behav-\\niors of the class. An operation refers to what objects of the class can do. It is usually\\nimplemented as a method of the class.\\nFigure A1.1 presents a simple example of a Thoroughbred class that models\\nthoroughbred horses. It has three attributes displayed—mother, father, and birthyear.\\nThe diagram also shows three operations: getCurrentAge(), getFather(), and\\ngetMother(). There may be other suppressed attributes and operations not shown in\\nthe diagram.\\nEach attribute can have a name, a type, and a level of visibility. The type and visi-\\nbility are optional. The type follows the name and is separated from the name by a\\n842 APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO UML\\n2 If you are unfamiliar with object-oriented concepts, a brief introduction is presented in Appendix 2.\\nThoroughbred\\n-father: Thoroughbred\\n-mother: Thoroughbred\\n-birthyear: int\\n+getFather(): Thoroughbred\\n+getMother(): Thoroughbred\\n+getCurrentAge(currentYear:Date): int\\nFIGURE A1.1\\nA class\\ndiagram for a\\nThoroughbred\\nclass\\npre75977_Apx1.qxd  11/27/08  6:41 PM  Page 842'),\n",

The visibility is indicated by a preceding –, #, ~, or +, indicating, respectively,\\nprivate, protected, package,or public visibility. In Figure A1.1, all attributes have private\\nvisibility, as indicated by the leading minus sign (–). You can also specify that an\\nattribute is a static or class attribute by underlining it. Each operation can also be dis-\\nplayed with a level of visibility, parameters with names and types, and a return type.\\nAn abstract class or abstract method is indicated by the use of italics for the name\\nin the class diagram. See the Horse class in Figure A1.2 for an example. An inter-\\nface is indicated by adding the phrase “«interface»” (called a stereotype) above the\\nname. See the OwnedObject interface in Figure A1.2. An interface can also be\\nrepresented graphically by a hollow circle.\\nIt is worth mentioning that the icon representing a class can have other optional\\nparts. For example, a fourth section at the bottom of the class box can be used to list\\nthe responsibilities of the class. This section is particularly useful when transitioning\\nfrom CRC cards (Chapter 6) to class diagrams in that the responsibilities listed on the\\nCRC cards can be added to this fourth section in the class box in the UML diagram\\nbefore creating the attributes and operations that carry out these responsibilities.\\nThis fourth section is not shown in any of the figures in this appendix.\\nClass diagrams can also show relationships between classes. A class that is a\\nsubclass of another class is connected to it by an arrow with a solid line for its shaft\\nand with a triangular hollow arrowhead. The arrow points from the subclass to the\\nsuperclass. In UML, such a relationship is called a generalization. For example, in\\nFigure A1.2, the Thoroughbred and QuarterHorse classes are shown to be sub-\\nclasses of the Horse abstract class. An arrow with a dashed line for the arrow shaft\\nindicates implementation of an interface. In UML, such a relationship is called a\\nrealization. For example, in Figure A1.2, the Horse class implements or realizes the\\nOwnedObject interface.\\nAPPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO UML 843\\nHorse\\n-name:String\\n+getName():String\\n+getOwner().Person\\n<< interface >>\\nOwnedObject\\nThoroughbred QuarterHorse\\nPerson*   owner\\nDate uses\\nFIGURE A1.2\\nA class\\ndiagram\\nregarding\\nhorses\\npre75977_Apx1.qxd  11/27/08  6:41 PM  Page 843'),\n",

Associations are represented by solid lines. An association has many\\noptional parts. It can be labeled, as can each of its ends, to indicate the role of each\\nclass in the association. For example, in Figure A1.2, there is an association between\\nOwnedObject and Person in which the Personplays the role of owner. Arrows on\\neither or both ends of an association line indicate navigability. Also, each end of the\\nassociation line can have a multiplicity value displayed. Navigability and multiplicity\\nare explained in more detail later in this section. An association might also connect\\na class with itself, using a loop. Such an association indicates the connection of an\\nobject of the class with other objects of the same class.\\nAn association with an arrow at one end indicates one-way navigability. The\\narrow means that from one class you can easily access the second associated class\\nto which the association points, but from the second class, you cannot necessarily\\neasily access the first class. Another way to think about this is that the first class is\\naware of the second class, but the second class object is not necessarily directly\\naware of the first class. An association with no arrows usually indicates a two-way\\nassociation, which is what was intended in Figure A1.2, but it could also just mean\\nthat the navigability is not important and so was left off.\\nIt should be noted that an attribute of a class is very much the same thing as an\\nassociation of the class with the class type of the attribute. That is, to indicate that a\\nclass has a property called “name” of type String, one could display that property\\nas an attribute, as in the Horse class in Figure A1.2. Alternatively, one could create\\na one-way association from the Horse class to the String class with the role of the\\nString class being “name.” The attribute approach is better for primitive data types,\\nwhereas the association approach is often better if the property’s class plays a major\\nrole in the design, in which case it is valuable to have a class box for that type.\\nA dependency relationship represents another connection between classes and\\nis indicated by a dashed line (with optional arrows at the ends and with optional\\nlabels). One class depends on another if changes to the second class might require\\nchanges to the first class. An association from one class to another automatically\\nindicates a dependency. No dashed line is needed between classes if there is already\\nan association between them. However, for a transient relationship (i.e., a class that\\ndoes not maintain any long-term connection to another class but does use that class\\noccasionally) we should draw a dashed line from the first class to the second. For\\nexample, in Figure A1.2, the Thoroughbredclass uses the Date class whenever its\\ngetCurrentAge() method is invoked, and so the dependency is labeled “uses.”\\nThe multiplicity of one end of an association means the number of objects of that\\nclass associated with the other class. A multiplicity is specified by a nonnegative\\ninteger or by a range of integers. A multiplicity specified by “0..1” means that there are\\n0 or 1 objects on that end of the association. For example, each person in the world\\nhas either a Social Security number or no such number (especially if they are not U.S.\\n844 APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO UML\\npre75977_Apx1.qxd  11/27/08  6:41 PM  Page 844'),\n",

A multiplicity\\nspecified by “1..*” means one or more, and a multiplicity specified by “0..*” or just “*“\\nmeans zero or more. An * was used as the multiplicity on theOwnedObject end of\\nthe association with classPerson in Figure A1.2 because aPerson can own zero or\\nmore objects.\\nIf one end of an association has multiplicity greater than 1, then the objects of the\\nclass referred to at that end of the association are probably stored in a collection,\\nsuch as a set or ordered list. One could also include that collection class itself in the\\nUML diagram, but such a class is usually left out and is implicitly assumed to be there\\ndue to the multiplicity of the association.\\nAn aggregation is a special kind of association indicated by a hollow diamond on\\none end of the icon. It indicates a “whole/part” relationship, in that the class to which\\nthe arrow points is considered a “part” of the class at the diamond end of the asso-\\nciation. A composition is an aggregation indicating strong ownership of the parts. In\\na composition, the parts live and die with the owner because they have no role in the\\nsoftware system independent of the owner. See Figure A1.3 for examples of aggre-\\ngation and composition.\\nA College has an aggregation of Building objects, which represent the buildings\\nmaking up the campus. The college also has a collection of courses. If the college\\nwere to fold, the buildings would still exist (assuming the college wasn’t physically\\ndestroyed) and could be used for other things, but a Course object has no use out-\\nside of the college at which it is being offered. If the college were to cease to exist as\\na business entity, the Course object would no longer be useful and so it would also\\ncease to exist.\\nAnother common element of a class diagram is a note, which is represented by\\na box with a dog-eared corner and is connected to other icons by a dashed line. It\\ncan have arbitrary content (text and graphics) and is similar to comments in pro-\\ngramming languages. It might contain comments about the role of a class or con-\\nstraints that all objects of that class must satisfy. If the contents are a constraint,\\nbraces surround the contents.

In\\nFigure A1.4, the paths are labeled with the communication protocol and the type of\\nnetwork used to connect the devices.\\nEach node in a deployment diagram can also be annotated with details about\\nthe device. For example, in Figure A1.4, the browser client is depicted to show that\\nit contains an artifact consisting of the Web browser software. An artifact is typically\\na file containing software running on a device. You can also specify tagged values,\\nas is shown in Figure A1.4 in the Web server node. These values define the vendor\\nof the Web server and the operating system used by the server.\\nDeployment diagrams can also display execution environment nodes, which are\\ndrawn as boxes containing the label “«execution environment»”. These nodes rep-\\nresent systems, such as operating systems, that can host other software.\\n846 APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO UML\\n{web server = apache}\\n{OS = linux}\\n<<device>>\\nWeb Server\\nhttp/LAN\\nhttp/Internet\\n<<device>>\\nRender engine\\n<<artifact>>\\nweb brower\\n<<device>>\\nBrowser Client\\nFIGURE A1.4\\nA deployment\\ndiagram\\npre75977_Apx1.qxd  11/27/08  6:41 PM  Page 846'),\n",

To give you a\\nfeeling for how use cases and use-case diagrams work, I’ll create some for a soft-\\nware application for managing digital music files, similar to Apple’s iTunes software.\\nSome of the things the software might do include:\\n• Download an MP3 music file and store it in the application’s library.\\n• Capture streaming music and store it in the application’s library.\\n• Manage the application’s library (e.g., delete songs or organize them in\\nplaylists).\\n• Burn a list of the songs in the library onto a CD.\\n• Load a list of the songs in the library onto an iPod or MP3 player.\\n• Convert a song from MP3 format to AAC format and vice versa.\\nThis is not an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to understand the role of use cases\\nand use-case diagrams.\\nA use case describes how a user interacts with the system by defining the steps\\nrequired to accomplish a specific goal (e.g., burning a list of songs onto a CD). Vari-\\nations in the sequence of steps describe various scenarios (e.g., what if all the songs\\nin the list don’t fit on one CD?).\\nA UML use-case diagram is an overview of all the use cases and how they are\\nrelated. It provides a big picture of the functionality of the system. A use-case\\ndiagram for the digital music application is shown in Figure A1.5.\\nIn this diagram, the stick figure represents an actor (Chapter 5) that is associ-\\nated with one category of user (or other interaction element). Complex systems\\ntypically have more than one actor. For example, a vending machine application\\nmight have three actors representing customers, repair personnel, and vendors\\nwho refill the machine.\\nIn the use-case diagram, the use cases are displayed as ovals. The actors are con-\\nnected by lines to the use cases that they carry out. Note that none of the details of\\nthe use cases are included in the diagram and instead need to be stored separately.\\nNote also that the use cases are placed in a rectangle but the actors are not. This rec-\\ntangle is a visual reminder of the system boundaries and that the actors are outside\\nthe system.\\nSome use cases in a system might be related to each other. For example, there are\\nsimilar steps in burning a list of songs to a CD and in loading a list of songs to an\\niPod. In both cases, the user first creates an empty list and then adds songs from the\\nlibrary to the list. To avoid duplication in use cases, it is usually better to create a\\nnew use case representing the duplicated activity, and then let the other uses cases\\ninclude this new use case as one of their steps. Such inclusion is indicated in\\nAPPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO UML 847\\npre75977_Apx1.qxd  11/27/08  6:42 PM  Page 847'),\n",

A black circle with an arrow\\ncoming from it indicates a found message whose source is unknown or irrelevant.\\nYou should now be able to understand the task that Figure A1.7 is displaying. An\\nunknown source calls the mouseClicked() method of a MouseListener, passing in\\nthe point where the click occurred as the argument. The MouseListener in turn\\ncalls the getFigureAt() method of a Drawing, which returns a Figure.

It is similar to\\na flowchart except that an activity diagram can show concurrent flows.\\nThe main component of an activity diagram is an action node, represented by a\\nrounded rectangle, which corresponds to a task performed by the software system.\\nArrows from one action node to another indicate the flow of control. That is, an\\narrow between two action nodes means that after the first action is complete the\\nsecond action begins. A solid black dot forms the initial nodethat indicates the start-\\ning point of the activity. A black dot surrounded by a black circle is the final node\\nindicating the end of the activity.\\nA fork represents the separation of activities into two or more concurrent activi-\\nties. It is drawn as a horizontal black bar with one arrow pointing to it and two or\\nmore arrows pointing out from it. Each outgoing arrow represents a flow of control\\nthat can be executed concurrently with the flows corresponding to the other outgo-\\ning arrows. These concurrent activities can be performed on a computer using dif-\\nferent threads or even using different computers.\\nFigure A1.11 shows a sample activity diagram involving baking a cake. The first\\nstep is finding the recipe. Once the recipe has been found, the dry ingredients and\\nwet ingredients can be measured and mixed and the oven can be preheated. The\\nmixing of the dry ingredients can be done in parallel with the mixing of the wet\\ningredients and the preheating of the oven.\\nAPPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO UML 853\\npre75977_Apx1.qxd  11/27/08  6:42 PM  Page 853'),\n",

As a trivial example, con-\\nsider an object with a Boolean instance variable. When asked to perform an opera-\\ntion, the object might do one thing if that variable is true and do something else if it\\nis false.\\nA UML state diagram models an object’s states, the actions that are performed\\ndepending on those states, and the transitions between the states of the object.\\nAs an example, consider the state diagram for a part of a Java compiler. The input\\nto the compiler is a text file, which can be thought of as a long string of characters.\\nThe compiler reads characters one at a time and from them determines the structure\\nof the program. One small part of this process of reading the characters involves\\nignoring “white-space” characters (e.g., the space, tab, newline, and return charac-\\nters) and characters inside a comment.\\nSuppose that the compiler delegates to a WhiteSpaceAndCommentEliminator\\nthe job of advancing over white-space characters and characters in comments. That\\nis, this object’s job is to read input characters until all white-space and comment char-\\nacters have been read, at which point it returns control to the compiler to read and\\nprocess non-white-space and noncomment characters. Think about how the\\nWhiteSpaceAndCommentEliminator object reads in characters and determines\\nwhether the next character is white space or part of a comment. The object can check\\nfor white space by testing the next character against “ ”, “\\\\t”, “\\\\n”, and “\\\\r”. But how\\ndoes it determine whether the next character is part of a comment? For example,\\nwhen it sees a“/”for the first time, it doesn’t yet know whether that character repre-\\nsents a division operator, part of the /= operator, or the beginning of a line or block\\ncomment. To make this determination, WhiteSpaceAndCommentEliminator\\nneeds to make a note of the fact that it saw a “/” and then move on to the next\\ncharacter. If the character following the “/” is another “/” or an “*”, then\\nWhiteSpaceAndCommentEliminatorknows that it is now reading a comment and\\ncan advance to the end of the comment without processing or saving any characters.\\nIf the character following the first “/” is anything other than a “/” or an “*”, then\\nWhiteSpaceAndCommentEliminator knows that the “/” represents the division\\noperator or part of the /= operator and so it stops advancing over characters.\\nIn summary, as WhiteSpaceAndCommentEliminator reads in characters, it\\nneeds to keep track of several things, including whether the current character is white\\nspace, whether the previous character it read was a “/”, whether it is currently read-\\ning characters in a comment, whether it has reached the end of comment, and so forth.\\n856 APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO UML\\npre75977_Apx1.qxd  11/27/08  6:42 PM  Page 856'),\n",

In each of these states, WhiteSpaceAndCommentEliminator behaves dif-\\nferently with regard to the next character read in.\\nTo help you visualize all the states of this object and how it changes state, you can\\nuse a UML state diagram as shown in Figure A1.13. A state diagram displays states us-\\ning rounded rectangles, each of which has a name in its upper half. There is also a black\\ncircle called the “initial pseudostate,” which isn’t really a state and instead just points\\nto the initial state. In Figure A1.13, the startstate is the initial state. Arrows from one\\nstate to another state indicate transitions or changes in the state of the object. Each\\ntransition is labeled with a trigger event, a slash (/), and an activity. All parts of the\\ntransition labels are optional in state diagrams. If the object is in one state and the trig-\\nger event for one of its transitions occurs, then that transition’s activity is performed\\nand the object takes on the new state indicated by the transition.

Study the diagram\\nto make sure you understand it. Note that, after advancing past white space or a\\ncomment, WhiteSpaceAndCommentEliminatorgoes back to the start state and\\nstarts over. That behavior is necessary since there might be several successive com-\\nments or white-space characters before any other characters in the Java source code.\\nAn object may transition to a final state, indicated by a black circle with a white\\ncircle around it, which indicates there are no more transitions. In Figure A1.13, the\\nWhiteSpaceAndCommentEliminator object is finished when the next character\\nis not white space or part of a comment. Note that all transitions except the two tran-\\nsitions leading to the final state have activities consisting of advancing to the next\\ncharacter. The two transitions to the final state do not advance over the next char-\\nacter because the next character is part of a word or symbol of interest to the com-\\npiler. Note that if the object is in the saw ‘/’state but the next character is not “/” or\\n“*”, then the “/” is a division operator or part of the /= operator and so we don’t want\\nto advance. In fact, we want to back up one character to make the “/” into the next\\ncharacter, so that the “/” can be used by the compiler. In Figure A1.13, this activity\\nof backing up is labeled as pushback ‘/’.\\nA state diagram will help you to uncover missed or unexpected situations. That\\nis, with a state diagram, it is relatively easy to ensure that all possible trigger events\\nfor all possible states have been accounted for. For example, in Figure A1.13, you can\\neasily verify that every state has included transitions for all possible characters.\\nUML state diagrams can contain many other features not included in Figure A1.13.\\nFor example, when an object is in a state, it usually does nothing but sit and wait for\\na trigger event to occur. However, there is a special kind of state, called an activity\\nstate, in which the object performs some activity, called a do-activity, while it is in that\\nstate. To indicate that a state is an activity state in the state diagram, you include in\\nthe bottom half of the state’s rounded rectangle the phrase “do/” followed by the\\nactivity that is to be done while in that state. The do-activity may finish before any\\nstate transitions occur, after which the activity state behaves like a normal waiting\\nstate. If a transition out of the activity state occurs before the do-activity is finished,\\nthen the do-activity is interrupted.\\nBecause a trigger event is optional when a transition occurs, it is possible that no\\ntrigger event may be listed as part of a transition’s label. In such cases for normal\\nwaiting states, the object will immediately transition from that state to the new state.\\nFor activity states, such a transition is taken as soon as the do-activity finishes.\\nFigure A1.14 illustrates this situation using the states for a business telephone.\\nWhen a caller is placed on hold, the call goes into the on hold with music state\\n(soothing music is played for 10 seconds).

However, graphical representations\\nare often not enough. You may need a mechanism for explicitly and formally repre-\\nsenting information that constrains some element of the design model. It is possible,\\nof course, to describe constraints in a natural language such as English, but this\\napproach invariably leads to inconsistency and ambiguity. For this reason, a more\\nformal language—one that draws on set theory and formal specification languages\\n(see Chapter 21) but has the somewhat less mathematical syntax of a programming\\nlanguage—seems appropriate.\\nThe Object Constraint Language (OCL) complements UML by allowing you to use\\na formal grammar and syntax to construct unambiguous statements about various\\ndesign model elements (e.g., classes and objects, events, messages, interfaces). The\\nsimplest OCL statements are constructed in four parts: (1) a context that defines the\\nlimited situation in which the statement is valid, (2) a property that represents some\\ncharacteristics of the context (e.g., if the context is a class, a property might be an\\nattribute), (3) an operation (e.g., arithmetic, set-oriented) that manipulates or quali-\\nfies a property, and (4) keywords (e.g., if, then, else, and, or, not, implies ) that\\nare used to specify conditional expressions.\\nAs a simple example of an OCL expression, consider the printing system dis-\\ncussed in Chapter 10. The guard condition placed on the jobCostAccepted event that\\nAPPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO UML 859\\non hold with music\\ndo/play soothing music for 10 seconds\\nput on hold\\ncanceled conversing\\n# key pushed taken off hold\\nhang up\\ndial tone\\nFIGURE A1.14\\nA state\\ndiagram with\\nan activity\\nstate and a\\ntriggerless\\ntransition\\npre75977_Apx1.qxd  11/27/08  6:42 PM  Page 859'),\n",

In the diagram (Figure 10.9),\\nthe guard condition is expressed in natural language and implies that authorization\\ncan only occur if the customer is authorized to approve the cost of the job. In OCL,\\nthe expression may take the form:\\ncustomer\\nself.authorizationAuthority /H11549‘yes’\\nwhere a Boolean attribute, authorizationAuthority, of the class (actually a specific\\ninstance of the class) named Customermust be set to “yes” for the guard condition\\nto be satisfied.\\nAs the design model is created, there are often instances in which pre- or post-\\nconditions must be satisfied prior to completion of some action specified by the\\ndesign. OCL provides a powerful tool for specifying pre- and postconditions in a\\nformal manner. As an example, consider an extension to the print shop system\\n(discussed as an example in Chapter 10) in which the customer provides an upper\\ncost bound for the print job and a “drop-dead” delivery date at the same time as other\\nprint job characteristics are specified. If cost and delivery estimates exceed these\\nbounds, the job is not submitted and the customer must be notified. In OCL, a set of\\npre- and postconditions may be specified in the following manner:\\ncontext PrintJob::validate(upperCostBound : Integer, custDeliveryReq :\\nInteger)\\npre: upperCostBound > 0\\nand custDeliveryReq > 0\\nand self.jobAuthorization /H11549‘no’\\npost: if self.totalJobCost </H11549upperCostBound\\nand self.deliveryDate </H11549custDeliveryReq\\nthen\\nself.jobAuthorization = ‘yes’\\nendif\\nThis OCL statement defines an invariant (inv)—conditions that must exist prior to\\n(pre) and after (post) some behavior. Initially, a precondition establishes that bound-\\ning cost and delivery date must be specified by the customer, and authorization must\\nbe set to “no.” After costs and delivery are determined, the postcondition specified is\\napplied. It should also be noted that the expression: \\nself.jobAuthorization = ‘yes’\\nis not assigning the value “yes” but is declaring that the jobAuthorization must have\\nbeen set to “yes” by the time the operation finishes.

Why is a method considered\\nto be object oriented? What is an object? As OO concepts gained wide-\\nspread adherents during the 1980s and 1990s, there were many differ-\\nent opinions about the correct answers to these questions, but today a coherent\\nview of OO concepts has emerged. This appendix is designed to provide you with\\na brief overview of this important topic and to introduce basic concepts and\\nterminology.\\nTo understand the object-oriented point of view, consider an example of a real-\\nworld object—the thing you are sitting in right now—a chair. Chair is a subclass\\nof a much larger class that we can call PieceOfFurniture. Individual chairs are\\nmembers (usually called instances) of the class Chair. A set of generic attributes\\ncan be associated with every object in the class PieceOfFurniture. For example,\\nall furniture has a cost, dimensions, weight, location, and color, among many pos-\\nsible attributes. These apply whether we are talking about a table or a chair, a sofa\\nor an armoire. Because Chair is a member of PieceOfFurniture, Chair inherits\\nall attributes defined for the class.\\nWe have attempted an anecdotal definition of a class by describing its attrib-\\nutes, but something is missing. Every object in the class PieceOfFurniture can\\nbe manipulated in a variety of ways. It can be bought and sold, physically modi-\\nfied (e.g., you can saw off a leg or paint the object purple), or moved from one\\nplace to another. Each of these operations (other terms are services or methods)\\nwill modify one or more attributes of the object. For example, if the attribute\\nlocation is a composite data item defined as\\nlocation /H11549building /H11545floor /H11545room\\nthen an operation named move() would modify one or more of the data items\\n(building, floor, or room) that form the attribute location. To do this, move()must have\\n“knowledge” of these data items. The operation move() could be used for a chair\\nor a table, as long as both are instances of the class PieceOfFurniture. Valid\\noperations for the class PieceOfFurniture—buy(), sell(), weigh()—are specified as\\npart of the class definition and are inherited by all instances of the class.\\nThe class Chair (and all objects in general) encapsulates data (the attribute\\nvalues that define the chair), operations (the actions that are applied to change\\nthe attributes of chair), other objects, constants (set values), and other related\\ninformation. Encapsulation means that all of this information is packaged under\\none name and can be reused as one specification or program component.\\n863\\nAPPENDIX\\n2\\nOBJECT-ORIENTED\\nCONCEPTS\\nKEY\\nCONCEPTS\\nattributes . . . . .865\\nclasses . . . . . . .864\\nboundary  . . . .866\\ncharacteristics . .869\\ncontroller  . . . .866\\ndefinition  . . . .863\\ndesign  . . . . . .868\\nentity  . . . . . .866\\nencapsulation  . .863\\ninheritance  . . . .866\\nmessages  . . . . .867\\nmethods . . . . . .865\\noperations  . . . .865\\npolymorphism . .868\\nservices  . . . . . .865\\nsubclass  . . . . . .865\\nsuperclass  . . . .865\\npre75977_Apx2.qxd  11/27/08  6:45 PM  Page 863'),\n",

Communication is discussed\\nlater in this appendix.\\nCLASSES AND OBJECTS\\nA class is an OO concept that encapsulates the data and procedural abstractions\\nrequired to describe the content and behavior of some real-world entity. Data\\nabstractions that describe the class are enclosed by a “wall” of procedural abstrac-\\ntions [Tay90] (represented in Figure A2.1) that are capable of manipulating the data\\nin some way. In a well-designed class, the only way to reach the attributes (and\\noperate on them) is to go through one of the methods that form the “wall” illustrated\\nin the figure. Therefore, the class encapsulates data (inside the wall) and the pro-\\ncessing that manipulates the data (the methods that make up the wall). This achieves\\ninformation hiding (Chapter 8) and reduces the impact of side effects associated with\\nchange. Since the methods tend to manipulate a limited number of attributes, their\\ncohesion is improved, and because communication occurs only through the meth-\\nods that make up the “wall,” the class tends to be less strongly coupled from other\\nelements of a system.\\n1\\n864 APPENDIX 2 OBJECT-ORIENTED CONCEPTS\\nAttributes\\nMethod1()\\nMethod3() Method4()\\nMethodn()Method2()\\nFIGURE A2.1\\nA schematic\\nrepresentation\\nof a class\\n1 It should be noted, however, that coupling can become a serious problem in OO systems.

By definition, objects are in-\\nstances of a specific class and inherit its attributes and the operations that are\\navailable to manipulate the attributes. A superclass(often called a base class) is a gen-\\neralization of a set of classes that are related to it. A subclass is a specialization of\\nthe superclass. For example, the superclass MotorVehicle is a generalization of the\\nclasses Truck, SUV, Automobile,and Van. The subclass Automobile inherits all\\nattributes of MotorVehicle, but in addition, incorporates additional attributes that\\nare specific only to automobiles.\\nThese definitions imply the existence of a class hierarchy in which the attributes\\nand operations of the superclass are inherited by subclasses that may each add\\nadditional “private” attributes and methods. For example, the operations sitOn()and\\nturn() might be private to the Chair subclass.\\nATTRIBUTES\\nYou have learned that attributes are attached to classes and that they describe the\\nclass in some way. An attribute can take on a value defined by an enumerated\\ndomain. In most cases, a domain is simply a set of specific values. For example,\\nassume that a class Automobilehas an attribute color. The domain of values for color\\nis {white, black, silver, gray, blue, red, yellow, green}. In more complex situa-\\ntions, the domain can be a class. Continuing the example, the class Automobilealso\\nhas an attribute powerTrainthat is itself a class. The class PowerTrainwould contain\\nattributes that describe the specific engine and transmission for the car.\\nThe features (values of the domain) can be augmented by assigning a default value\\n(feature) to an attribute. For example, the colorattribute defaults to white. It may also\\nbe useful to associate a probability with a particular feature by assigning {value,\\nprobability} pairs. Consider the color attribute for automobile. In some applications\\n(e.g., manufacturing planning) it might be necessary to assign a probability to each\\nof the colors (e.g., white and black are highly probable as automobile colors).\\nOPERATIONS , M ETHODS , AND SERVICES\\nAn object encapsulates data (represented as a collection of attributes) and the algo-\\nrithms that process the data.

Whenever an object receives a stimulus, it initiates some\\nbehavior. This can be as simple as retrieving the color of automobile or as complex\\nas the initiation of a chain of stimuli that are passed among a variety of different\\nobjects. In the latter case, consider an example in which the initial stimulus received\\nby Object 1 results in the generation of two other stimuli that are sent to Object 2\\nand Object 3. Operations encapsulated by the second and third objects act on the\\nstimuli, returning necessary information to the first object. Object 1 then uses the\\nreturned information to satisfy the behavior demanded by the initial stimulus.\\nOBJECT -O RIENTED ANALYSIS AND DESIGN CONCEPTS\\nRequirements modeling (also called analysis modeling) focuses primarily on classes\\nthat are extracted directly from the statement of the problem. These entity classestyp-\\nically represent things that are to be stored in a database and persist throughout the\\nduration of the application (unless they are specifically deleted).\\nDesign refines and extends the set of entity classes. Boundary and controller\\nclasses are developed and/or refined during design. Boundary classes create the\\ninterface (e.g., interactive screen and printed reports) that the user sees and inter-\\nacts with as the software is used. Boundary classes are designed with the responsi-\\nbility of managing the way entity objects are represented to users.\\nController classes are designed to manage (1) the creation or update of entity\\nobjects, (2) the instantiation of boundary objects as they obtain information from\\nentity objects, (3) complex communication between sets of objects, and (4) valida-\\ntion of data communicated between objects or between the user and the application.\\nThe concepts discussed in the paragraphs that follow can be useful in analysis and\\ndesign work.\\nInheritance. Inheritance is one of the key differentiators between conventional and\\nobject-oriented systems. A subclass Y inherits all of the attributes and operations\\nassociated with its superclass X. This means that all data structures and algorithms\\noriginally designed and implemented for X are immediately available for Y—no\\nfurther work need be done. Reuse has been accomplished directly.\\nAny change to the attributes or operations contained within a superclass is\\nimmediately inherited by all subclasses. Therefore, the class hierarchy becomes a\\nmechanism through which changes (at high levels) can be immediately propagated\\nthrough a system.\\nIt is important to note that at each level of the class hierarchy new attributes and\\noperations may be added to those that have been inherited from higher levels in the\\nhierarchy. In fact, whenever a new class is to be created, you have a number of options:\\n• The class can be designed and built from scratch. That is, inheritance is not\\nused.\\n866 APPENDIX 2 OBJECT-ORIENTED CONCEPTS\\npre75977_Apx2.qxd  11/27/08  6:45 PM  Page 866'),\n",

Classes must interact with one another to achieve design goals. A mes-\\nsage stimulates some behavior to occur in the receiving object. The behavior is\\naccomplished when an operation is executed.\\nThe interaction between objects is illustrated schematically in Figure A2.2. An\\noperation within SenderObject generates a message of the form message\\n(<parameters>) where the parameters identify ReceiverObject as the object to be\\nstimulated by the message, the operation withinReceiverObjectthat is to receive the\\nmessage, and the data items that provide information that is required for the operation\\nto be successful. The collaboration defined between classes as part of the require-\\nments model provides useful guidance in the design of messages.\\nCox [Cox86] describes the interchange between classes in the following manner:\\nAn object [class] is requested to perform one of its operations by sending it a message\\ntelling the object what to do. The receiver [object] responds to the message by first choos-\\ning the operation that implements the message name, executing this operation, and then\\nreturning control to the caller.

Polymorphism is a characteristic that greatly reduces the effort\\nrequired to extend the design of an existing object-oriented system. To understand\\npolymorphism, consider a conventional application that must draw four different\\ntypes of graphs: line graphs, pie charts, histograms, and Kiviat diagrams. Ideally,\\nonce data are collected for a particular type of graph, the graph should draw itself.\\nTo accomplish this in a conventional application (and maintain module cohesion), it\\nwould be necessary to develop drawing modules for each type of graph. Then, within\\nthe design, control logic similar to the following would have to be embedded:\\ncase of graphtype:\\nif graphtype /H11549linegraph then DrawLineGraph (data);\\nif graphtype /H11549piechart then DrawPieChart (data);\\nif graphtype /H11549histogram then DrawHisto (data);\\nif graphtype /H11549kiviat then DrawKiviat (data);\\nend case;\\nAlthough this design is reasonably straightforward, adding new graph types could be\\ntricky. A new drawing module would have to be created for each graph type and then\\nthe control logic would have to be updated to reflect the new graph type.\\nTo solve this problem in an object-oriented system, all of the graphs become sub-\\nclasses of a general class called Graph. Using a concept called overloading [Tay90],\\neach subclass defines an operation called draw. An object can send a drawmessage\\nto any one of the objects instantiated from any one of the subclasses. The object\\nreceiving the message will invoke its own draw operation to create the appropriate\\ngraph. Therefore, the design is reduced to\\ndraw <graphtype>\\nWhen a new graph type is to be added to the system, a subclass is created with its own\\ndraw operation. But no changes are required within any object that wants a graph\\ndrawn because the message draw <graphtype> remains unchanged. To summarize,\\npolymorphism enables a number of different operations to have the same name. This\\nin turn decouples objects from one another, making each more independent.\\nDesign classes. The requirements model defines a complete set of analysis\\nclasses. Each describes some element of the problem domain, focusing on aspects\\nof the problem that are user or customer visible. The level of abstraction of an analy-\\nsis class is relatively high.\\nAs the design model evolves, the software team must define a set of design classes\\nthat (1) refine the analysis classes by providing design detail that will enable the\\nclasses to be implemented and (2) create a new set of design classes that implement\\na software infrastructure that supports the business solution.

The classes identify the attributes and operations (methods) that are\\nrequired to implement some element of the business domain.\\n• Process classes implement lower-level business abstractions required to fully\\nmanage the business domain classes.\\n• Persistent classes represent data stores (e.g., a database) that will persist\\nbeyond the execution of the software.\\n• System classes implement software management and control functions that\\nenable the system to operate and communicate within its computing envi-\\nronment and with the outside world.\\nAs the architectural design evolves, the software team should develop a complete\\nset of attributes and operations for each design class.

That is,\\nanalysis classes represent objects (and associated methods that are applied to them)\\nusing the jargon of the business domain. Design classes present significantly more\\ntechnical detail as a guide for implementation.\\nArlow and Neustadt [Arl02] suggest that each design class be reviewed to ensure\\nthat it is “well formed.” They define four characteristics of a well-formed design class:\\nComplete and sufficient. A design class should be the complete encapsu-\\nlation of all attributes and methods that can reasonably be expected (based\\non a knowledgeable interpretation of the class name) to exist for the class.\\nFor example, the class Scene defined for video-editing software is complete\\nonly if it contains all attributes and methods that can reasonably be associ-\\nated with the creation of a video scene. Sufficiency ensures that the design\\nclass contains only those methods that are sufficient to achieve the intent of\\nthe class, no more and no less.\\nPrimitiveness. Methods associated with a design class should be focused\\non accomplishing one specific function for the class. Once the function has\\nbeen implemented with a method, the class should not provide another way\\nto accomplish the same thing. For example, the class VideoClip of the video\\nediting software might have attributes start-point and end-point to indicate the\\nstart and end points of the clip (note that the raw video loaded into the sys-\\ntem may be longer than the clip that is used). The methods, setStartPoint()\\nand setEndPoint() provide the only means for establishing start and end\\npoints for the clip.\\nAPPENDIX 2 OBJECT-ORIENTED CONCEPTS 869\\npre75977_Apx2.qxd  11/27/08  6:45 PM  Page 869'),\n",

A cohesive design class is single minded. That is, it has a\\nsmall, focused set of responsibilities and single-mindedly applies attributes\\nand methods to implement those responsibilities. For example, the class\\nVideoClip of the video-editing software might contain a set of methods for\\nediting the video clip. As long as each method focuses solely on attributes\\nassociated with the video clip, cohesion is maintained.\\nLow coupling. Within the design model, it is necessary for design classes\\nto collaborate with one another. However, collaboration should be kept to an\\nacceptable minimum. If a design model is highly coupled (all design classes\\ncollaborate with all other design classes), the system is difficult to implement,\\ntest, and maintain over time. In general, design classes within a subsystem\\nshould have only limited knowledge of other classes. This restriction, called\\nthe Law of Demeter [Lie03], suggests that a method should only send mes-\\nsages to methods in neighboring classes.\\n4\\nFURTHER READINGS AND INFORMATION SOURCES\\nOver the past three decades hundreds of books have been written on object-oriented pro-\\ngramming, analysis, and design. Weisfeld (The Object-Oriented Thought Process, 2d ed., Sams\\nPublishing, 2003) presents a worthwhile treatment of general OO concepts and principles.\\nMcLaughlin and his colleagues (Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design: A Brain Friendly\\nGuide to OOA&D, O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2006) provide an accessible and enjoyable treatment of\\nOO analysis and design approaches. A more in-depth treatment of OO analysis and design is\\npresented by Booch and his colleagues (Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications,\\n3d ed., Addison-Wesley, 2007). Wu ( An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java,\\nMcGraw-Hill, 2005) has written a comprehensive book on OO programming that is typical of\\ndozens written for many different programming languages.\\nA wide variety of information sources on object-oriented technologies is available on the\\nInternet.

The framework encompasses a process, a\\nset of methods, and an array of tools that we call software engineering.\\n1.1 T HE NATURE OF SOFTWARE\\nToday, software takes on a dual role. It is a product, and at the same time, the vehi-\\ncle for delivering a product. As a product, it delivers the computing potential em-\\nbodied by computer hardware or more broadly, by a network of computers that are\\naccessible by local hardware. Whether it resides within a mobile phone or operates\\ninside a mainframe computer, software is an information transformer—producing,\\nmanaging, acquiring, modifying, displaying, or transmitting information that can be\\nas simple as a single bit or as complex as a multimedia presentation derived from\\ndata acquired from dozens of independent sources. As the vehicle used to deliver the\\nproduct, software acts as the basis for the control of the computer (operating sys-\\ntems), the communication of information (networks), and the creation and control\\nof other programs (software tools and environments).\\nSoftware delivers the most important product of our time—information. It trans-\\nforms personal data (e.g., an individual’s financial transactions) so that the data can\\nbe more useful in a local context; it manages business information to enhance com-\\npetitiveness; it provides a gateway to worldwide information networks (e.g., the\\nInternet), and provides the means for acquiring information in all of its forms.\\nThe role of computer software has undergone significant change over the last\\nhalf-century. Dramatic improvements in hardware performance, profound changes\\nin computing architectures, vast increases in memory and storage capacity, and a\\nwide variety of exotic input and output options, have all precipitated more sophisti-\\ncated and complex computer-based systems. Sophistication and complexity can\\nproduce dazzling results when a system succeeds, but they can also pose huge\\nproblems for those who must build complex systems.\\nToday, a huge software industry has become a dominant factor in the economies\\nof the industrialized world. Teams of software specialists, each focusing on one part\\nof the technology required to deliver a complex application, have replaced the lone\\nprogrammer of an earlier era. And yet, the questions that were asked of the lone\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 3\\nSoftware is both a\\nproduct and a vehicle\\nthat delivers a product.\\nuote:\\n“Software is a\\nplace where\\ndreams are planted\\nand nightmares\\nharvested, an\\nabstract, mystical\\nswamp where\\nterrible demons\\ncompete with\\nmagical panaceas,\\na world of\\nwerewolves and\\nsilver bullets.”\\nBrad J.

He states: “Instead of asking why software costs so much, we need to begin asking ‘What\\nhave we done to make it possible for today’s software to cost so little?’ The answer to that ques-\\ntion will help us continue the extraordinary level of achievement that has always distinguished the\\nsoftware industry.”\\n• Why does it take so long to get software finished?\\n• Why are development costs so high?\\n• Why can’t we find all errors before we give the software to our customers?\\n• Why do we spend so much time and effort maintaining existing \\nprograms?\\n• Why do we continue to have difficulty in measuring progress as software is\\nbeing developed and maintained?\\nThese, and many other questions, are a manifestation of the concern about\\nsoftware and the manner in which it is developed—a concern that has lead to the\\nadoption of software engineering practice.\\n1.1.1 Defining Software\\nToday, most professionals and many members of the public at large feel that they\\nunderstand software. But do they?\\nA textbook description of software might take the following form: \\nSoftware is: (1) instructions (computer programs) that when executed provide desired\\nfeatures, function, and performance; (2) data structures that enable the programs to ad-\\nequately manipulate information, and (3) descriptive information in both hard copy and\\nvirtual forms that describes the operation and use of the programs.\\nThere is no question that other more complete definitions could be offered.\\nBut a more formal definition probably won’t measurably improve your under-\\nstanding. To accomplish that, it’s important to examine the characteristics of soft-\\nware that make it different from other things that human beings build. Software is a\\nlogical rather than a physical system element. Therefore, software has characteris-\\ntics that are considerably different than those of hardware:\\n1. Software is developed or engineered; it is not manufactured in the classical sense.\\nAlthough some similarities exist between software development and hard-\\nware manufacturing, the two activities are fundamentally different. In both\\nactivities, high quality is achieved through good design, but the manufactur-\\ning phase for hardware can introduce quality problems that are nonexistent\\nHow should\\nwe define\\nsoftware?\\n?\\nSoftware is\\nengineered, not\\nmanufactured.\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 4'),\n",

Both activities are dependent on people,\\nbut the relationship between people applied and work accomplished is\\nentirely different (see Chapter 24). Both activities require the construction of\\na “product,” but the approaches are different. Software costs are concen-\\ntrated in engineering. This means that software projects cannot be managed\\nas if they were manufacturing projects.\\n2. Software doesn’t “wear out.”\\nFigure 1.1 depicts failure rate as a function of time for hardware. The rela-\\ntionship, often called the “bathtub curve,” indicates that hardware exhibits\\nrelatively high failure rates early in its life (these failures are often attributa-\\nble to design or manufacturing defects); defects are corrected and the failure\\nrate drops to a steady-state level (hopefully, quite low) for some period of\\ntime. As time passes, however, the failure rate rises again as hardware com-\\nponents suffer from the cumulative effects of dust, vibration, abuse, tempera-\\nture extremes, and many other environmental maladies. Stated simply, the\\nhardware begins to wear out.\\nSoftware is not susceptible to the environmental maladies that cause\\nhardware to wear out. In theory, therefore, the failure rate curve for software\\nshould take the form of the “idealized curve” shown in Figure 1.2. Undiscov-\\nered defects will cause high failure rates early in the life of a program.\\nHowever, these are corrected and the curve flattens as shown. The idealized\\ncurve is a gross oversimplification of actual failure models for software.\\nHowever, the implication is clear—software doesn’t wear out. But it does\\ndeteriorate!\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 5\\n“Wear out”“Infant\\nmortality”\\nTime\\nFailure rate\\nFIGURE 1.1\\nFailure curve\\nfor hardware\\nSoftware doesn’t wear\\nout, but it does\\ndeteriorate.\\nIf you want to reduce\\nsoftware deterioration,\\nyou’ll have to do\\nbetter software design\\n(Chapters 8 to 13).\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 5'),\n",

During its life,2 software will undergo change. As\\nchanges are made, it is likely that errors will be introduced, causing the\\nfailure rate curve to spike as shown in the “actual curve” (Figure 1.2). Before\\nthe curve can return to the original steady-state failure rate, another change\\nis requested, causing the curve to spike again. Slowly, the minimum failure\\nrate level begins to rise—the software is deteriorating due to change.\\nAnother aspect of wear illustrates the difference between hardware and\\nsoftware. When a hardware component wears out, it is replaced by a spare\\npart. There are no software spare parts. Every software failure indicates an\\nerror in design or in the process through which design was translated into\\nmachine executable code.

Other\\nsystems applications (e.g., operating system components, drivers, networking\\nsoftware, telecommunications processors) process largely indeterminate data.\\nIn either case, the systems software area is characterized by heavy interaction\\nwith computer hardware; heavy usage by multiple users; concurrent opera-\\ntion that requires scheduling, resource sharing, and sophisticated process\\nmanagement; complex data structures; and multiple external interfaces.\\nApplication software—stand-alone programs that solve a specific business\\nneed. Applications in this area process business or technical data in a way\\nthat facilitates business operations or management/technical decision mak-\\ning. In addition to conventional data processing applications, application\\nsoftware is used to control business functions in real time (e.g., point-of-sale\\ntransaction processing, real-time manufacturing process control).\\nEngineering/scientific software—has been characterized by “number\\ncrunching” algorithms. Applications range from astronomy to volcanology,\\nfrom automotive stress analysis to space shuttle orbital dynamics, and\\nfrom molecular biology to automated manufacturing.

Embedded software can perform limited and esoteric functions\\n(e.g., key pad control for a microwave oven) or provide significant function\\nand control capability (e.g., digital functions in an automobile such as fuel\\ncontrol, dashboard displays, and braking systems).\\nProduct-line software—designed to provide a specific capability for use by\\nmany different customers. Product-line software can focus on a limited and\\nesoteric marketplace (e.g., inventory control products) or address mass\\nconsumer markets (e.g., word processing, spreadsheets, computer graphics,\\nmultimedia, entertainment, database management, and personal and\\nbusiness financial applications).\\nWeb applications—called “WebApps,” this network-centric software cate-\\ngory spans a wide array of applications. In their simplest form, WebApps can\\nbe little more than a set of linked hypertext files that present information\\nusing text and limited graphics. However, as Web 2.0 emerges, WebApps are\\nevolving into sophisticated computing environments that not only provide\\nstand-alone features, computing functions, and content to the end user, but\\nalso are integrated with corporate databases and business applications.\\nArtificial intelligence software—makes use of nonnumerical algorithms to\\nsolve complex problems that are not amenable to computation or straightfor-\\nward analysis. Applications within this area include robotics, expert systems,\\npattern recognition (image and voice), artificial neural networks, theorem\\nproving, and game playing.\\nMillions of software engineers worldwide are hard at work on software projects in\\none or more of these categories.

Some of these are state-\\nof-the-art software—just released to individuals, industry, and government. But\\nother programs are older, in some cases much older.\\nThese older programs—often referred to as legacy software—have been the focus\\nof continuous attention and concern since the 1960s. Dayani-Fard and his\\ncolleagues [Day99] describe legacy software in the following way:\\nLegacy software systems . . . were developed decades ago and have been continually\\nmodified to meet changes in business requirements and computing platforms. The pro-\\nliferation of such systems is causing headaches for large organizations who find them\\ncostly to maintain and risky to evolve.\\nLiu and his colleagues [Liu98] extend this description by noting that “many legacy\\nsystems remain supportive to core business functions and are ‘indispensable’ to\\nthe business.” Hence, legacy software is characterized by longevity and business\\ncriticality.\\nUnfortunately, there is sometimes one additional characteristic that is present\\nin legacy software— poor quality.\\n5 Legacy systems sometimes have inextensible\\ndesigns, convoluted code, poor or nonexistent documentation, test cases and results\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 9\\nuote:\\n“You can’t always\\npredict, but you\\ncan always\\nprepare.”\\nAnonymous\\n5 In this case, quality is judged based on modern software engineering thinking—a somewhat unfair\\ncriterion since some modern software engineering concepts and principles may not have been well\\nunderstood at the time that the legacy software was developed.\\nWhat do I do\\nif I encounter\\na legacy system\\nthat exhibits poor\\nquality?\\n?\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 9'),\n",

And yet, these systems support “core business functions and are indispensable\\nto the business.” What to do?\\nThe only reasonable answer may be: Do nothing, at least until the legacy system\\nmust undergo some significant change. If the legacy software meets the needs of its\\nusers and runs reliably, it isn’t broken and does not need to be fixed. However, as\\ntime passes, legacy systems often evolve for one or more of the following reasons:\\n• The software must be adapted to meet the needs of new computing environ-\\nments or technology.\\n• The software must be enhanced to implement new business requirements.\\n• The software must be extended to make it interoperable with other more\\nmodern systems or databases.\\n• The software must be re-architected to make it viable within a network\\nenvironment.\\nWhen these modes of evolution occur, a legacy system must be reengineered (Chap-\\nter 29) so that it remains viable into the future. The goal of modern software engi-\\nneering is to “devise methodologies that are founded on the notion of evolution”;\\nthat is, the notion that software systems continually change, new software systems\\nare built from the old ones, and . . . all must interoperate and cooperate with each\\nother” [Day99].\\n1.2 T HE UNIQUE NATURE OF WEB APPS\\nIn the early days of the World Wide Web (circa 1990 to 1995), websites consisted of\\nlittle more than a set of linked hypertext files that presented information using text\\nand limited graphics. As time passed, the augmentation of HTML by development\\ntools (e.g., XML, Java) enabled Web engineers to provide computing capability along\\nwith informational content. Web-based systems and applications\\n6 (I refer to these col-\\nlectively as WebApps) were born. Today, WebApps have evolved into sophisticated\\ncomputing tools that not only provide stand-alone function to the end user, but also\\nhave been integrated with corporate databases and business applications.\\nAs noted in Section 1.1.2, WebApps are one of a number of distinct software cat-\\negories. And yet, it can be argued that WebApps are different. Powell [Pow98] sug-\\ngests that Web-based systems and applications “involve a mixture between print\\npublishing and software development, between marketing and computing, between\\n10 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\\nWhat types\\nof changes\\nare made to\\nlegacy systems?\\n?\\nEvery software\\nengineer must\\nrecognize that change\\nis natural.

Included\\nwithin this category are complete websites, specialized functionality within websites, and infor-\\nmation processing applications that reside on the Internet or on an Intranet or Extranet.\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 10'),\n",

A WebApp resides on a network and must serve\\nthe needs of a diverse community of clients. The network may enable world-\\nwide access and communication (i.e., the Internet) or more limited access\\nand communication (e.g., a corporate Intranet).\\nConcurrency. A large number of users may access the WebApp at one\\ntime. In many cases, the patterns of usage among end users will vary greatly.\\nUnpredictable load. The number of users of the WebApp may vary by\\norders of magnitude from day to day. One hundred users may show up on\\nMonday; 10,000 may use the system on Thursday.\\nPerformance. If a WebApp user must wait too long (for access, for server-\\nside processing, for client-side formatting and display), he or she may decide\\nto go elsewhere.\\nAvailability. Although expectation of 100 percent availability is unreason-\\nable, users of popular WebApps often demand access on a 24/7/365 basis.\\nUsers in Australia or Asia might demand access during times when tradi-\\ntional domestic software applications in North America might be taken \\noff-line for maintenance.\\nData driven. The primary function of many WebApps is to use hypermedia\\nto present text, graphics, audio, and video content to the end user. In addi-\\ntion, WebApps are commonly used to access information that exists on data-\\nbases that are not an integral part of the Web-based environment (e.g.,\\ne-commerce or financial applications).\\nContent sensitive. The quality and aesthetic nature of content remains an\\nimportant determinant of the quality of a WebApp.\\nContinuous evolution. Unlike conventional application software that\\nevolves over a series of planned, chronologically spaced releases, Web appli-\\ncations evolve continuously. It is not unusual for some WebApps (specifically,\\ntheir content) to be updated on a minute-by-minute schedule or for content\\nto be independently computed for each request.\\nImmediacy. Although immediacy—the compelling need to get software to\\nmarket quickly—is a characteristic of many application domains, WebApps\\noften exhibit a time-to-market that can be a matter of a few days or weeks.\\n7\\nSecurity. Because WebApps are available via network access, it is difficult,\\nif not impossible, to limit the population of end users who may access the\\napplication.

When a new application or embedded system is to be built, many\\nvoices must be heard. And it sometimes seems that each of them has a\\nslightly different idea of what software features and functions should be\\ndelivered. It follows that a concerted effort should be made to understand the\\nproblem before a software solution is developed.\\n• The information technology requirements demanded by individuals, busi-\\nnesses, and governments grow increasing complex with each passing year.\\nLarge teams of people now create computer programs that were once built\\nby a single individual. Sophisticated software that was once implemented in\\na predictable, self-contained, computing environment is now embedded\\ninside everything from consumer electronics to medical devices to weapons\\nsystems. The complexity of these new computer-based systems and products\\ndemands careful attention to the interactions of all system elements. It\\nfollows that design becomes a pivotal activity.\\n• Individuals, businesses, and governments increasingly rely on software for\\nstrategic and tactical decision making as well as day-to-day operations and\\ncontrol. If the software fails, people and major enterprises can experience\\nanything from minor inconvenience to catastrophic failures. It follows that\\nsoftware should exhibit high quality.\\n• As the perceived value of a specific application grows, the likelihood is that\\nits user base and longevity will also grow. As its user base and time-in-use\\n12 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\\n8 I will call these people “stakeholders” later in this book.\\nUnderstand the\\nproblem before you\\nbuild a solution.Design is a pivotal\\nsoftware engineering\\nactivity.\\nBoth quality and\\nmaintainability are an\\noutgrowth of good\\ndesign.\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 12'),\n",

It follows\\nthat software should be maintainable.\\nThese simple realities lead to one conclusion:software in all of its forms and across all\\nof its application domains should be engineered. And that leads us to the topic of this\\nbook—software engineering.\\nAlthough hundreds of authors have developed personal definitions of software\\nengineering, a definition proposed by Fritz Bauer [Nau69] at the seminal conference\\non the subject still serves as a basis for discussion:\\n[Software engineering is] the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in or-\\nder to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.\\nYou will be tempted to add to this definition.9 It says little about the technical as-\\npects of software quality; it does not directly address the need for customer satisfac-\\ntion or timely product delivery; it omits mention of the importance of measurement\\nand metrics; it does not state the importance of an effective process. And yet, Bauer’s\\ndefinition provides us with a baseline. What are the “sound engineering principles”\\nthat can be applied to computer software development? How do we “economically”\\nbuild software so that it is “reliable”? What is required to create computer programs\\nthat work “efficiently” on not one but many different “real machines”? These are the\\nquestions that continue to challenge software engineers.\\nThe IEEE [IEE93a] has developed a more comprehensive definition when it states:\\nSoftware Engineering: (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach\\nto the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of\\nengineering to software. (2) The study of approaches as in (1).\\nAnd yet, a “systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable” approach applied by one\\nsoftware team may be burdensome to another. We need discipline, but we also need\\nadaptability and agility.\\nSoftware engineering is a layered technology. Referring to Figure 1.3, any engineer-\\ning approach (including software engineering) must rest on an organizational com-\\nmitment to quality. Total quality management, Six Sigma, and similar philosophies\\n10\\nfoster a continuous process improvement culture, and it is this culture that ultimately\\nleads to the development of increasingly more effective approaches to software engi-\\nneering. The bedrock that supports software engineering is a quality focus.\\nThe foundation for software engineering is the process layer.

An activity strives to achieve a broad objective\\n(e.g., communication with stakeholders) and is applied regardless of the application\\ndomain, size of the project, complexity of the effort, or degree of rigor with which\\nsoftware engineering is to be applied. An action (e.g., architectural design) encom-\\npasses a set of tasks that produce a major work product (e.g., an architectural design\\nmodel). A task focuses on a small, but well-defined objective (e.g., conducting a unit\\ntest) that produces a tangible outcome.\\nIn the context of software engineering, a process is not a rigid prescription for how\\nto build computer software.

Carry out the plan (code generation).\\n4. Examine the result for accuracy (testing and quality assurance).\\nIn the context of software engineering, these commonsense steps lead to a series of\\nessential questions [adapted from Pol45]:\\nUnderstand the problem. It’s sometimes difficult to admit, but most of us suffer\\nfrom hubris when we’re presented with a problem. We listen for a few seconds and\\nthen think, Oh yeah, I understand, let’s get on with solving this thing. Unfortunately,\\nunderstanding isn’t always that easy. It’s worth spending a little time answering a\\nfew simple questions:\\n• Who has a stake in the solution to the problem? That is, who are the stake-\\nholders?\\n• What are the unknowns? What data, functions, and features are required to\\nproperly solve the problem?\\n• Can the problem be compartmentalized? Is it possible to represent smaller\\nproblems that may be easier to understand?\\n• Can the problem be represented graphically?Can an analysis model be created?\\nPlan the solution. Now you understand the problem (or so you think) and you\\ncan’t wait to begin coding. Before you do, slow down just a bit and do a little\\ndesign:\\n• Have you seen similar problems before? Are there patterns that are recogniz-\\nable in a potential solution? Is there existing software that implements the\\ndata, functions, and features that are required?\\n• Has a similar problem been solved? If so, are elements of the solution\\nreusable?\\n• Can subproblems be defined? If so, are solutions readily apparent for the\\nsubproblems?\\n• Can you represent a solution in a manner that leads to effective implementation?\\nCan a design model be created?\\nCarry out the plan. The design you’ve created serves as a road map for the\\nsystem you want to build. There may be unexpected detours, and it’s possible that\\nyou’ll discover an even better route as you go, but the “plan” will allow you to\\nproceed without getting lost.\\n• Does the solution conform to the plan? Is source code traceable to the design\\nmodel?\\n• Is each component part of the solution provably correct? Have the design and\\ncode been reviewed, or better, have correctness proofs been applied to the\\nalgorithm?\\n18 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\\nuote:\\n“There is a grain of\\ndiscovery in the\\nsolution of any\\nproblem.”\\nGeorge Polya\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 18'),\n",

In fact, it’s\\nreasonable to state that a commonsense approach to software engineering will\\nnever lead you astray.\\n1.5.2 General Principles\\nThe dictionary defines the word principle as “an important underlying law or as-\\nsumption required in a system of thought.” Throughout this book I’ll discuss princi-\\nples at many different levels of abstraction. Some focus on software engineering as a\\nwhole, others consider a specific generic framework activity (e.g., communication),\\nand still others focus on software engineering actions (e.g., architectural design) or\\ntechnical tasks (e.g., write a usage scenario). Regardless of their level of focus, prin-\\nciples help you establish a mind-set for solid software engineering practice. They are\\nimportant for that reason.\\nDavid Hooker [Hoo96] has proposed seven principles that focus on software\\nengineering practice as a whole. They are reproduced in the following\\nparagraphs:\\n13\\nThe First Principle: The Reason It All Exists\\nA software system exists for one reason: to provide value to its users. All\\ndecisions should be made with this in mind. Before specifying a system require-\\nment, before noting a piece of system functionality, before determining the hard-\\nware platforms or development processes, ask yourself questions such as: “Does\\nthis add real value to the system?” If the answer is “no,” don’t do it. All other\\nprinciples support this one.\\nThe Second Principle: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!)\\nSoftware design is not a haphazard process. There are many factors to consider\\nin any design effort. All design should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. This\\nfacilitates having a more easily understood and easily maintained system. This is\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 19\\n13 Reproduced with permission of the author [Hoo96]. Hooker defines patterns for these principles at\\nhttp:/ /c2.com/cgi/wiki?SevenPrinciplesOfSoftwareDevelopment.\\nBefore beginning a\\nsoftware project, be\\nsure the software has\\na business purpose and\\nthat users perceive\\nvalue in it.\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 19'),\n",

Indeed, the more elegant designs are usually the more simple ones. Sim-\\nple also does not mean “quick and dirty.” In fact, it often takes a lot of thought and\\nwork over multiple iterations to simplify. The payoff is software that is more main-\\ntainable and less error-prone.\\nThe Third Principle: Maintain the Vision\\nA clear vision is essential to the success of a software project. Without one, a\\nproject almost unfailingly ends up being “of two [or more] minds” about itself.\\nWithout conceptual integrity, a system threatens to become a patchwork of in-\\ncompatible designs, held together by the wrong kind of screws. . . . Compromis-\\ning the architectural vision of a software system weakens and will eventually\\nbreak even the well-designed systems. Having an empowered architect who can\\nhold the vision and enforce compliance helps ensure a very successful software\\nproject.\\nThe Fourth Principle: What You Produce, Others Will Consume\\nSeldom is an industrial-strength software system constructed and used in a\\nvacuum. In some way or other, someone else will use, maintain, document, or\\notherwise depend on being able to understand your system. So, always specify,\\ndesign, and implement knowing someone else will have to understand what you are\\ndoing. The audience for any product of software development is potentially large.\\nSpecify with an eye to the users. Design, keeping the implementers in mind. Code\\nwith concern for those that must maintain and extend the system. Someone may\\nhave to debug the code you write, and that makes them a user of your code.\\nMaking their job easier adds value to the system.\\nThe Fifth Principle: Be Open to the Future\\nA system with a long lifetime has more value. In today’s computing environ-\\nments, where specifications change on a moment’s notice and hardware platforms\\nare obsolete just a few months old, software lifetimes are typically measured in\\nmonths instead of years. However, true “industrial-strength” software systems\\nmust endure far longer. To do this successfully, these systems must be ready to\\nadapt to these and other changes. Systems that do this successfully are those that\\nhave been designed this way from the start. Never design yourself into a corner.\\nAlways ask “what if,” and prepare for all possible answers by creating systems that\\nsolve the general problem, not just the specific one.\\n14 This could very possibly lead\\nto the reuse of an entire system.\\n20 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\\nIf software has value,\\nit will change over its\\nuseful life. For that\\nreason, software must\\nbe built to be\\nmaintainable.\\n14 This advice can be dangerous if it is taken to extremes. Designing for the “general problem” some-\\ntimes requires performance compromises and can make specific solutions inefficient.\\nuote:\\n“There is a certain\\nmajesty in\\nsimplicity which is\\nfar above all the\\nquaintness of wit.”\\nAlexander Pope\\n(1688–1744)\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 20'),\n",

The reuse of code and\\ndesigns has been proclaimed as a major benefit of using object-oriented technolo-\\ngies. However, the return on this investment is not automatic. To leverage the\\nreuse possibilities that object-oriented [or conventional] programming provides\\nrequires forethought and planning. There are many techniques to realize reuse\\nat every level of the system development process. . . . Planning ahead for reuse\\nreduces the cost and increases the value of both the reusable components and the\\nsystems into which they are incorporated.\\nThe Seventh principle: Think!\\nThis last principle is probably the most overlooked. Placing clear, complete\\nthought before action almost always produces better results. When you think about\\nsomething, you are more likely to do it right. You also gain knowledge about how\\nto do it right again. If you do think about something and still do it wrong, it be-\\ncomes a valuable experience. A side effect of thinking is learning to recognize\\nwhen you don’t know something, at which point you can research the answer.\\nWhen clear thought has gone into a system, value comes out. Applying the first six\\nprinciples requires intense thought, for which the potential rewards are enormous.\\nIf every software engineer and every software team simply followed Hooker’s seven\\nprinciples, many of the difficulties we experience in building complex computer-\\nbased systems would be eliminated.\\n1.6 S OFTWARE MYTHS\\nSoftware myths—erroneous beliefs about software and the process that is used to\\nbuild it—can be traced to the earliest days of computing. Myths have a number of\\nattributes that make them insidious. For instance, they appear to be reasonable\\nstatements of fact (sometimes containing elements of truth), they have an intuitive\\nfeel, and they are often promulgated by experienced practitioners who “know the\\nscore.”\\nToday, most knowledgeable software engineering professionals recognize myths\\nfor what they are—misleading attitudes that have caused serious problems for\\nmanagers and practitioners alike. However, old attitudes and habits are difficult to\\nmodify, and remnants of software myths remain.\\nCHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 21\\n15 Although this is true for those who reuse the software on future projects, reuse can be expensive\\nfor those who must design and build reusable components. Studies indicate that designing and\\nbuilding reusable components can cost between 25 to 200 percent more than targeted software. In\\nsome cases, the cost differential cannot be justified.\\nuote:\\n“In the absence of\\nmeaningful\\nstandards, a new\\nindustry like\\nsoftware comes to\\ndepend instead on\\nfolklore.”\\nTom DeMarco\\npre75977_ch01.qxd  11/27/08  3:11 PM  Page 21'),\n",

Won’t that provide my people with everything they\\nneed to know?\\nReality: The book of standards may very well exist, but is it used? Are soft-\\nware practitioners aware of its existence?

In the words of Brooks [Bro95]: “adding people to a late soft-\\nware project makes it later.” At first, this statement may seem\\ncounterintuitive. However, as new people are added, people who\\nwere working must spend time educating the newcomers, thereby\\nreducing the amount of time spent on productive development\\neffort.

Computer software is the product that software profession- als build and then support over the long term. It encompasses programs that execute within a computer of any size and architecture, content that is presented as the computer programs execute, and descriptive information in both hard copy and virtual forms that encompass virtually any electronic media. Software engineering encompasses a process, a collection of methods (practice) and an array of tools that allow professionals to build high- quality computer software. Who does it? Software engineers build and sup- port software, and virtually everyone in the indus- trialized world uses it either directly or indirectly. Why is it important? Software is important because it affects nearly every aspect of our lives and has become pervasive in our com- merce, our culture, and our everyday activities. QUICK LOOK Software engineering is important because it enables us to build complex systems in a timely manner and with high quality. What are the steps? You build computer soft- ware like you build any successful product, by applying an agile, adaptable process that leads to a high-quality result that meets the needs of the people who will use the product. You apply a software engineering approach. What is the work product? From the point of view of a software engineer, the work product is the set of programs, content (data), and other work products that are computer software. But from the user’s viewpoint, the work product is the resultant information that somehow makes the user’s world better. How do I ensure that I’ve done it right?

The framework encompasses a process, a set of methods, and an array of tools that we call software engineering. 1.1 T HE NATURE OF SOFTWARE Today, software takes on a dual role. It is a product, and at the same time, the vehi- cle for delivering a product. As a product, it delivers the computing potential em- bodied by computer hardware or more broadly, by a network of computers that are accessible by local hardware. Whether it resides within a mobile phone or operates inside a mainframe computer, software is an information transformer—producing, managing, acquiring, modifying, displaying, or transmitting information that can be as simple as a single bit or as complex as a multimedia presentation derived from data acquired from dozens of independent sources. As the vehicle used to deliver the product, software acts as the basis for the control of the computer (operating sys- tems), the communication of information (networks), and the creation and control of other programs (software tools and environments). Software delivers the most important product of our time—information. It trans- forms personal data (e.g., an individual’s financial transactions) so that the data can be more useful in a local context; it manages business information to enhance com- petitiveness; it provides a gateway to worldwide information networks (e.g., the Internet), and provides the means for acquiring information in all of its forms. The role of computer software has undergone significant change over the last half-century. Dramatic improvements in hardware performance, profound changes in computing architectures, vast increases in memory and storage capacity, and a wide variety of exotic input and output options, have all precipitated more sophisti- cated and complex computer-based systems. Sophistication and complexity can produce dazzling results when a system succeeds, but they can also pose huge problems for those who must build complex systems. Today, a huge software industry has become a dominant factor in the economies of the industrialized world. Teams of software specialists, each focusing on one part of the technology required to deliver a complex application, have replaced the lone programmer of an earlier era. And yet, the questions that were asked of the lone CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 3 Software is both a product and a vehicle that delivers a product. uote: “Software is a place where dreams are planted and nightmares harvested, an abstract, mystical swamp where terrible demons compete with magical panaceas, a world of werewolves and silver bullets.” Brad J.'),\n",

He states: “Instead of asking why software costs so much, we need to begin asking ‘What have we done to make it possible for today’s software to cost so little?’ The answer to that ques- tion will help us continue the extraordinary level of achievement that has always distinguished the software industry.” • Why does it take so long to get software finished? • Why are development costs so high? • Why can’t we find all errors before we give the software to our customers? • Why do we spend so much time and effort maintaining existing  programs? • Why do we continue to have difficulty in measuring progress as software is being developed and maintained? These, and many other questions, are a manifestation of the concern about software and the manner in which it is developed—a concern that has lead to the adoption of software engineering practice. 1.1.1 Defining Software Today, most professionals and many members of the public at large feel that they understand software. But do they? A textbook description of software might take the following form:  Software is: (1) instructions (computer programs) that when executed provide desired features, function, and performance; (2) data structures that enable the programs to ad- equately manipulate information, and (3) descriptive information in both hard copy and virtual forms that describes the operation and use of the programs. There is no question that other more complete definitions could be offered. But a more formal definition probably won’t measurably improve your under- standing. To accomplish that, it’s important to examine the characteristics of soft- ware that make it different from other things that human beings build. Software is a logical rather than a physical system element. Therefore, software has characteris- tics that are considerably different than those of hardware: 1. Software is developed or engineered; it is not manufactured in the classical sense. Although some similarities exist between software development and hard- ware manufacturing, the two activities are fundamentally different. In both activities, high quality is achieved through good design, but the manufactur- ing phase for hardware can introduce quality problems that are nonexistent How should we define software? ?'),\n",

Software doesn’t “wear out.” Figure 1.1 depicts failure rate as a function of time for hardware. The rela- tionship, often called the “bathtub curve,” indicates that hardware exhibits relatively high failure rates early in its life (these failures are often attributa- ble to design or manufacturing defects); defects are corrected and the failure rate drops to a steady-state level (hopefully, quite low) for some period of time. As time passes, however, the failure rate rises again as hardware com- ponents suffer from the cumulative effects of dust, vibration, abuse, tempera- ture extremes, and many other environmental maladies.

In the hardware world, component reuse is a natural part of the engineering process. In the software world, it is something that has only begun to be achieved on a broad scale. A software component should be designed and implemented so that it can be reused in many different programs. Modern reusable components encap- sulate both data and the processing that is applied to the data, enabling the software engineer to create new applications from reusable parts. 3 For exam- ple, today’s interactive user interfaces are built with reusable components that enable the creation of graphics windows, pull-down menus, and a wide variety of interaction mechanisms. The data structures and processing detail required to build the interface are contained within a library of reusable components for interface construction. 1.1.2 Software Application Domains Today, seven broad categories of computer software present continuing challenges for software engineers: System software—a collection of programs written to service other pro- grams. Some system software (e.g., compilers, editors, and file management utilities) processes complex, but determinate, 4 information structures. Other systems applications (e.g., operating system components, drivers, networking software, telecommunications processors) process largely indeterminate data. In either case, the systems software area is characterized by heavy interaction with computer hardware; heavy usage by multiple users; concurrent opera- tion that requires scheduling, resource sharing, and sophisticated process management; complex data structures; and multiple external interfaces. Application software—stand-alone programs that solve a specific business need.'),\n",

The chal- lenge for software engineers is to build source code that is self-descriptive, but more importantly, to develop techniques that will enable both customers and developers to know what changes have been made and how those changes manifest themselves within the software. Each of these new challenges will undoubtedly obey the law of unintended conse- quences and have effects (for businesspeople, software engineers, and end users) that cannot be predicted today. However, software engineers can prepare by instantiating a process that is agile and adaptable enough to accommodate dramatic changes in technology and to business rules that are sure to come over the next decade. 1.1.3 Legacy Software Hundreds of thousands of computer programs fall into one of the seven broad application domains discussed in the preceding subsection. Some of these are state- of-the-art software—just released to individuals, industry, and government. But other programs are older, in some cases much older. These older programs—often referred to as legacy software—have been the focus of continuous attention and concern since the 1960s. Dayani-Fard and his colleagues [Day99] describe legacy software in the following way: Legacy software systems . . . were developed decades ago and have been continually modified to meet changes in business requirements and computing platforms. The pro- liferation of such systems is causing headaches for large organizations who find them costly to maintain and risky to evolve. Liu and his colleagues [Liu98] extend this description by noting that “many legacy systems remain supportive to core business functions and are ‘indispensable’ to the business.” Hence, legacy software is characterized by longevity and business criticality. Unfortunately, there is sometimes one additional characteristic that is present in legacy software— poor quality. 5 Legacy systems sometimes have inextensible designs, convoluted code, poor or nonexistent documentation, test cases and results CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 9 uote: “You can’t always predict, but you can always prepare.” Anonymous 5 In this case, quality is judged based on modern software engineering thinking—a somewhat unfair criterion since some modern software engineering concepts and principles may not have been well understood at the time that the legacy software was developed.

And yet, these systems support “core business functions and are indispensable to the business.” What to do? The only reasonable answer may be: Do nothing, at least until the legacy system must undergo some significant change. If the legacy software meets the needs of its users and runs reliably, it isn’t broken and does not need to be fixed. However, as time passes, legacy systems often evolve for one or more of the following reasons: • The software must be adapted to meet the needs of new computing environ- ments or technology. • The software must be enhanced to implement new business requirements. • The software must be extended to make it interoperable with other more modern systems or databases. • The software must be re-architected to make it viable within a network environment. When these modes of evolution occur, a legacy system must be reengineered (Chap- ter 29) so that it remains viable into the future.

As time passed, the augmentation of HTML by development tools (e.g., XML, Java) enabled Web engineers to provide computing capability along with informational content. Web-based systems and applications 6 (I refer to these col- lectively as WebApps) were born. Today, WebApps have evolved into sophisticated computing tools that not only provide stand-alone function to the end user, but also have been integrated with corporate databases and business applications. As noted in Section 1.1.2, WebApps are one of a number of distinct software cat- egories. And yet, it can be argued that WebApps are different.

Network intensiveness. A WebApp resides on a network and must serve the needs of a diverse community of clients. The network may enable world- wide access and communication (i.e., the Internet) or more limited access and communication (e.g., a corporate Intranet). Concurrency. A large number of users may access the WebApp at one time. In many cases, the patterns of usage among end users will vary greatly. Unpredictable load. The number of users of the WebApp may vary by orders of magnitude from day to day. One hundred users may show up on Monday; 10,000 may use the system on Thursday. Performance. If a WebApp user must wait too long (for access, for server- side processing, for client-side formatting and display), he or she may decide to go elsewhere. Availability. Although expectation of 100 percent availability is unreason- able, users of popular WebApps often demand access on a 24/7/365 basis. Users in Australia or Asia might demand access during times when tradi- tional domestic software applications in North America might be taken  off-line for maintenance. Data driven. The primary function of many WebApps is to use hypermedia to present text, graphics, audio, and video content to the end user. In addi- tion, WebApps are commonly used to access information that exists on data- bases that are not an integral part of the Web-based environment (e.g., e-commerce or financial applications). Content sensitive. The quality and aesthetic nature of content remains an important determinant of the quality of a WebApp. Continuous evolution. Unlike conventional application software that evolves over a series of planned, chronologically spaced releases, Web appli- cations evolve continuously. It is not unusual for some WebApps (specifically, their content) to be updated on a minute-by-minute schedule or for content to be independently computed for each request. Immediacy. Although immediacy—the compelling need to get software to market quickly—is a characteristic of many application domains, WebApps often exhibit a time-to-market that can be a matter of a few days or weeks. 7 Security. Because WebApps are available via network access, it is difficult, if not impossible, to limit the population of end users who may access the application.

Aesthetics. An undeniable part of the appeal of a WebApp is its look and feel. When an application has been designed to market or sell products or ideas, aesthetics may have as much to do with success as technical design. It can be argued that other application categories discussed in Section 1.1.2 can exhibit some of the attributes noted. However, WebApps almost always exhibit all of them. 1.3 S OFTWARE ENGINEERING In order to build software that is ready to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century, you must recognize a few simple realities: • Software has become deeply embedded in virtually every aspect of our lives, and as a consequence, the number of people who have an interest in the features and functions provided by a specific application 8 has grown dramati- cally. When a new application or embedded system is to be built, many voices must be heard. And it sometimes seems that each of them has a slightly different idea of what software features and functions should be delivered. It follows that a concerted effort should be made to understand the problem before a software solution is developed. • The information technology requirements demanded by individuals, busi- nesses, and governments grow increasing complex with each passing year. Large teams of people now create computer programs that were once built by a single individual. Sophisticated software that was once implemented in a predictable, self-contained, computing environment is now embedded inside everything from consumer electronics to medical devices to weapons systems. The complexity of these new computer-based systems and products demands careful attention to the interactions of all system elements. It follows that design becomes a pivotal activity. • Individuals, businesses, and governments increasingly rely on software for strategic and tactical decision making as well as day-to-day operations and control. If the software fails, people and major enterprises can experience anything from minor inconvenience to catastrophic failures. It follows that software should exhibit high quality. • As the perceived value of a specific application grows, the likelihood is that its user base and longevity will also grow. As its user base and time-in-use 12 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 8 I will call these people “stakeholders” later in this book.

Although hundreds of authors have developed personal definitions of software engineering, a definition proposed by Fritz Bauer [Nau69] at the seminal conference on the subject still serves as a basis for discussion: [Software engineering is] the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in or- der to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines. You will be tempted to add to this definition.9 It says little about the technical as- pects of software quality; it does not directly address the need for customer satisfac- tion or timely product delivery; it omits mention of the importance of measurement and metrics; it does not state the importance of an effective process.

How do we “economically” build software so that it is “reliable”? What is required to create computer programs that work “efficiently” on not one but many different “real machines”? These are the questions that continue to challenge software engineers. The IEEE [IEE93a] has developed a more comprehensive definition when it states: Software Engineering: (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software. (2) The study of approaches as in (1). And yet, a “systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable” approach applied by one software team may be burdensome to another. We need discipline, but we also need adaptability and agility. Software engineering is a layered technology. Referring to Figure 1.3, any engineer- ing approach (including software engineering) must rest on an organizational com- mitment to quality. Total quality management, Six Sigma, and similar philosophies 10 foster a continuous process improvement culture, and it is this culture that ultimately leads to the development of increasingly more effective approaches to software engi- neering.

Software engineering methods rely on a set of basic principles that govern each area of the technology and include modeling activities and other descriptive techniques. Software engineering tools provide automated or semiautomated support for the process and the methods. When tools are integrated so that information created by one tool can be used by another, a system for the support of software development, called computer-aided software engineering, is established. 1.4 T HE SOFTWARE PROCESS A process is a collection of activities, actions, and tasks that are performed when some work product is to be created. An activity strives to achieve a broad objective (e.g., communication with stakeholders) and is applied regardless of the application domain, size of the project, complexity of the effort, or degree of rigor with which software engineering is to be applied. An action (e.g., architectural design) encom- passes a set of tasks that produce a major work product (e.g., an architectural design model). A task focuses on a small, but well-defined objective (e.g., conducting a unit test) that produces a tangible outcome. In the context of software engineering, a process is not a rigid prescription for how to build computer software. Rather, it is an adaptable approach that enables the peo- ple doing the work (the software team) to pick and choose the appropriate set of work actions and tasks. The intent is always to deliver software in a timely manner and with sufficient quality to satisfy those who have sponsored its creation and those who will use it. 14 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING Tools A quality focus Methods Process FIGURE 1.3 Software engineering layers WebRef CrossTalk is a journal that provides pragmatic information on process, methods, and tools.

If required, you refine the sketch into greater and greater detail in an effort to better understand the problem and how you’re going to solve it. A software engineer does the same thing by creating mod- els to better understand software requirements and the design that will achieve those requirements. Construction. This activity combines code generation (either manual or automated) and the testing that is required to uncover errors in the code. Deployment. The software (as a complete entity or as a partially com- pleted increment) is delivered to the customer who evaluates the delivered product and provides feedback based on the evaluation. These five generic framework activities can be used during the development of small, simple programs, the creation of large Web applications, and for the engineering of large, complex computer-based systems. The details of the software process will be quite different in each case, but the framework activities remain the same.

That is, communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment are applied repeatedly through a number of project iterations. Each project iteration produces a software incrementthat provides stakeholders with a subset of overall software features and functionality. As each increment is pro- duced, the software becomes more and more complete. Software engineering process framework activities are complemented by a num- ber of umbrella activities.In general, umbrella activities are applied throughout a soft- ware project and help a software team manage and control progress, quality, change, and risk. Typical umbrella activities include: Software project tracking and control—allows the software team to assess progress against the project plan and take any necessary action to maintain the schedule. Risk management—assesses risks that may affect the outcome of the project or the quality of the product. Software quality assurance—defines and conducts the activities required to ensure software quality. Technical reviews—assesses software engineering work products in an effort to uncover and remove errors before they are propagated to the next activity. Measurement—defines and collects process, project, and product measures that assist the team in delivering software that meets stakeholders’ needs; can be used in conjunction with all other framework and umbrella activities. Software configuration management—manages the effects of change throughout the software process. Reusability management—defines criteria for work product reuse (including software components) and establishes mechanisms to achieve reusable components. Work product preparation and production—encompasses the activities required to create work products such as models, documents, logs, forms, and lists. Each of these umbrella activities is discussed in detail later in this book. Earlier in this section, I noted that the software engineering process is not a rigid prescription that must be followed dogmatically by a software team. Rather, it should be agile and adaptable (to the problem, to the project, to the team, and to the organi- zational culture). Therefore, a process adopted for one project might be significantly different than a process adopted for another project. Among the differences are • Overall flow of activities, actions, and tasks and the interdependencies among them • Degree to which actions and tasks are defined within each framework activity • Degree to which work products are identified and required 16 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING Umbrella activities occur throughout the software process and focus primarily on project management, tracking, and control.

If prescriptive models are applied dogmatically and without adaptation, they can in- crease the level of bureaucracy associated with building computer-based systems and inadvertently create difficulty for all stakeholders. Agile process models(Chapter 3) emphasize project “agility” and follow a set of prin- ciples that lead to a more informal (but, proponents argue, no less effective) approach to software process. These process models are generally characterized as “agile” be- cause they emphasize maneuverability and adaptability. They are appropriate for many types of projects and are particularly useful when Web applications are engineered. 1.5 S OFTWARE ENGINEERING PRACTICE In Section 1.4, I introduced a generic software process model composed of a set of activities that establish a framework for software engineering practice. Generic framework activities—communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment—and umbrella activities establish a skeleton architecture for software engineering work. But how does the practice of software engineering fit in? In the sections that follow, you’ll gain a basic understanding of the generic concepts and principles that apply to framework activities. 12 1.5.1 The Essence of Practice In a classic book, How to Solve It, written before modern computers existed, George Polya [Pol45] outlined the essence of problem solving, and consequently, the essence of software engineering practice: 1.

All other principles support this one. The Second Principle: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!) Software design is not a haphazard process. There are many factors to consider in any design effort. All design should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. This facilitates having a more easily understood and easily maintained system.

The payoff is software that is more main- tainable and less error-prone. The Third Principle: Maintain the Vision A clear vision is essential to the success of a software project. Without one, a project almost unfailingly ends up being “of two [or more] minds” about itself.'),\n",

Compromis- ing the architectural vision of a software system weakens and will eventually break even the well-designed systems. Having an empowered architect who can hold the vision and enforce compliance helps ensure a very successful software project. The Fourth Principle: What You Produce, Others Will Consume Seldom is an industrial-strength software system constructed and used in a vacuum. In some way or other, someone else will use, maintain, document, or otherwise depend on being able to understand your system. So, always specify, design, and implement knowing someone else will have to understand what you are doing. The audience for any product of software development is potentially large. Specify with an eye to the users. Design, keeping the implementers in mind. Code with concern for those that must maintain and extend the system. Someone may have to debug the code you write, and that makes them a user of your code. Making their job easier adds value to the system. The Fifth Principle: Be Open to the Future A system with a long lifetime has more value. In today’s computing environ- ments, where specifications change on a moment’s notice and hardware platforms are obsolete just a few months old, software lifetimes are typically measured in months instead of years. However, true “industrial-strength” software systems must endure far longer.'),\n",

Planning ahead for reuse reduces the cost and increases the value of both the reusable components and the systems into which they are incorporated. The Seventh principle: Think! This last principle is probably the most overlooked. Placing clear, complete thought before action almost always produces better results. When you think about something, you are more likely to do it right. You also gain knowledge about how to do it right again. If you do think about something and still do it wrong, it be- comes a valuable experience. A side effect of thinking is learning to recognize when you don’t know something, at which point you can research the answer. When clear thought has gone into a system, value comes out. Applying the first six principles requires intense thought, for which the potential rewards are enormous. If every software engineer and every software team simply followed Hooker’s seven principles, many of the difficulties we experience in building complex computer- based systems would be eliminated. 1.6 S OFTWARE MYTHS Software myths—erroneous beliefs about software and the process that is used to build it—can be traced to the earliest days of computing.'),\n",

People can be added but only in a planned and well- coordinated manner. Myth: If I decide to outsource the software project to a third party, I can just relax and let that firm build it.

A customer who requests computer software may be a person at the next desk, a technical group down the hall, the marketing/sales department, or an outside company that has requested software under contract. In many cases, the customer believes myths about software because software managers and prac- titioners do little to correct misinformation. Myths lead to false expectations (by the customer) and, ultimately, dissatisfaction with the developer.

Over the past 50 years, software has evolved from a specialized problem solving and infor- mation analysis tool to an industry in itself. Yet we still have trouble developing high- quality software on time and within budget. Software—programs, data, and descriptive information—addresses a wide array of technology and application areas. Legacy software continues to present special challenges to those who must maintain it. Web-based systems and applications have evolved from simple collections of in- formation content to sophisticated systems that present complex functionality and multimedia content. Although these WebApps have unique features and require- ments, they are software nonetheless. Software engineering encompasses process, methods, and tools that enable complex computer-based systems to be built in a timely manner with quality. The software process incorporates five framework activities—communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment—that are applicable to all software proj- ects. Software engineering practice is a problem solving activity that follows a set of core principles.'),\n",

The vast majority discuss programming languages or software applications, but a few discuss software itself. Pressman and Herron (Software Shock, Dorset House, 1991) presented an early discussion (directed at the layperson) of software and the way professionals build it. Negroponte’s best- selling book (Being Digital, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1995) provides a view of computing and its overall impact in the twenty-first century. DeMarco (Why Does Software Cost So Much? Dorset House, 1995) has produced a collection of amusing and insightful essays on software and the process through which it is developed. Minasi (The Software Conspiracy: Why Software Companies Put out Faulty Products, How They Can Hurt You, and What You Can Do, McGraw-Hill, 2000) argues that the “modern scourge” of software bugs can be eliminated and suggests ways to accomplish this. Compaine ( Digital Divide: Facing a Crisis or Creating a Myth,MIT Press, 2001) argues that the “divide” between those who have access to information resources (e.g., the Web) and those that do not is narrowing as we move into the first decade of this century. Books by Greenfield (Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing, New Riders Publishing, 2006) and Loke ( Context-Aware Pervasive Systems: Architectures for a New Breed of Applications, Auerbach, 2006) introduce the concept of “open-world” software and predict a wireless environment in which software must adapt to requirements that emerge in real time. The current state of the software engineering and the software process can best be deter- mined from publications such as IEEE Software, IEEE Computer, CrossTalk,and IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.'),\n",

      "programmer are the same questions that are asked when modern computer-based systems are built:1 4 CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 1 In an excellent book of essays on the software business, Tom DeMarco [DeM95] argues the coun- terpoint. He states: “Instead of asking why software costs so much, we need to begin asking ‘What have we done to make it possible for today’s software to cost so little?’ The answer to that ques- tion will help us continue the extraordinary level of achievement that has always distinguished the software industry.” • Why does it take so long to get software finished? • Why are development costs so high? • Why can’t we find all errors before we give the software to our customers? • Why do we spend so much time and effort maintaining existing  programs? • Why do we continue to have difficulty in measuring progress as software is being developed and maintained? These, and many other questions, are a manifestation of the concern about software and the manner in which it is developed—a concern that has lead to the adoption of software engineering practice. 1.1.1 Defining Software Today, most professionals and many members of the public at large feel that they understand software. But do they? A textbook description of software might take the following form:  Software is: (1) instructions (computer programs) that when executed provide desired features, function, and performance; (2) data structures that enable the programs to ad- equately manipulate information, and (3) descriptive information in both hard copy and virtual forms that describes the operation and use of the programs. There is no question that other more complete definitions could be offered. But a more formal definition probably won’t measurably improve your under- standing. To accomplish that, it’s important to examine the characteristics of soft- ware that make it different from other things that human beings build. Software is a logical rather than a physical system element. Therefore, software has characteris- tics that are considerably different than those of hardware: 1. Software is developed or engineered; it is not manufactured in the classical sense. Although some similarities exist between software development and hard- ware manufacturing, the two activities are fundamentally different. In both activities, high quality is achieved through good design, but the manufactur- ing phase for hardware can introduce quality problems that are nonexistent How should we define software? ?\n",

      "that must be established for effective delivery of software engineering technology. The software process forms the basis for management control of software projects and establishes the context in which technical methods are applied, work products (models, documents, data, reports, forms, etc.) are produced, milestones are estab- lished, quality is ensured, and change is properly managed. Software engineering methods provide the technical how-to’s for building soft- ware.\n",

      "What are the “sound engineering principles” that can be applied to computer software development? How do we “economically” build software so that it is “reliable”? What is required to create computer programs that work “efficiently” on not one but many different “real machines”? These are the questions that continue to challenge software engineers. The IEEE [IEE93a] has developed a more comprehensive definition when it states: Software Engineering: (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software. (2) The study of approaches as in (1). And yet, a “systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable” approach applied by one software team may be burdensome to another. We need discipline, but we also need adaptability and agility. Software engineering is a layered technology. Referring to Figure 1.3, any engineer- ing approach (including software engineering) must rest on an organizational com- mitment to quality. Total quality management, Six Sigma, and similar philosophies 10 foster a continuous process improvement culture, and it is this culture that ultimately leads to the development of increasingly more effective approaches to software engi- neering. The bedrock that supports software engineering is a quality focus. The foundation for software engineering is the process layer. The software engi- neering process is the glue that holds the technology layers together and enables rational and timely development of computer software. Process defines a framework CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 13 uote: “More than a discipline or a body of knowledge, engineering is a verb, an action word, a way of approaching a problem.” Scott Whitmir How do we define software engineering? ? 9 For numerous additional definitions of software engineering, see www.answers.com/topic/ software-engineering#wp-_note-13. 10 Quality management and related approaches are discussed in Chapter 14 and throughout Part 3 of this book.

      "CHAPTER 1 SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 25 With the exception of a passing reference, software was hardly mentioned as part of the conversation. And yet, software will make or break the SafeHome product line. The engineering effort will succeed only if SafeHomesoftware succeeds. The market will accept the product only if the software embedded within it properly meets the customer’s (as yet unstated) needs. We’ll follow the progression of SafeHome software engineering in many of the chapters that follow. 1.8 S UMMARY Software is the key element in the evolution of computer-based systems and products and one of the most important technologies on the world stage. Over the past 50 years, software has evolved from a specialized problem solving and infor- mation analysis tool to an industry in itself. Yet we still have trouble developing high- quality software on time and within budget. Software—programs, data, and descriptive information—addresses a wide array of technology and application areas. Legacy software continues to present special challenges to those who must maintain it. Web-based systems and applications have evolved from simple collections of in- formation content to sophisticated systems that present complex functionality and multimedia content. Although these WebApps have unique features and require- ments, they are software nonetheless. Software engineering encompasses process, methods, and tools that enable complex computer-based systems to be built in a timely manner with quality. The software process incorporates five framework activities—communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment—that are applicable to all software proj- ects. Software engineering practice is a problem solving activity that follows a set of core principles.\n",
