In RR, each process is assigned a time slice or quantum and if the process does not complete its task within that time slice, it is moved to the end of the queue so that other processes can get a chance to execute. This ensures that the process with the shortest remaining time gets to execute next, thereby reducing the average waiting time for all processes.",

However, it fails to meet the mark on Criteria A because Round Robin does not directly implement the SRTF principle like Shortest Job First (SJF). In SJF, tasks are prioritized based on their remaining execution time, which changes dynamically as tasks complete or make progress. RR, by contrast, assigns a fixed time slice to each task, regardless of its remaining execution time. The student's explanation is partially accurate in that it mentions the goal of reducing waiting times and allowing short tasks to get executed sooner, but this outcome is not specific enough to distinguish SRTF from other scheduling strategies.\n\nCriteria B is met partially because the student does mention how RR tries to achieve a similar outcome to SJF. However, it misses an important explanation: how SJF works and its importance in preventing job starvation. To meet the mark, the student should have explained that SJF prioritizes tasks based on their remaining execution time and dynamically adjusts priorities as tasks complete or make progress.\n\nCriteria C is not fully met because the student briefly mentions RR, but fails to provide a clear explanation of Round Robin and Multilevel Feedback Queue's differences from SJF. They also did not provide any mention of the other two algorithms that were part of the question, explaining their differences from SJF."
