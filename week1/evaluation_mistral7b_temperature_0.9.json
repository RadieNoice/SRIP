In RR, each process is assigned a time slice or quantum and if the process does not complete its task within that time slice, it is moved to the end of the queue so that other processes can get a chance to execute. This ensures that the process with the shortest remaining time gets to execute next, thereby reducing the average waiting time for all processes.",
